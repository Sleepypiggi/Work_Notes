Even if the insured does not pay the required premiums on the payment date, the insurer usually offers a **Grace Period** (~1 Month) from that date where they will accept the required payment with **no other penalty or requirement**. If the insured still does not pay the premiums by the end of the grace period, then the policy will **Lapse** - it is no longer in effect and the insurer will not respond to any claims made.
