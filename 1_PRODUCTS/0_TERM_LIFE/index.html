<h1 id="term-life-insurance"><strong>Term Life Insurance</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#term-life-insurance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<h2 id="overview"><strong>Overview</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The most basic type of life insurance is known as <strong>Term Insurance</strong>. As its name suggests, it provides an insurance cover ONLY for a <strong>specific timeframe</strong>, known as the <strong>term</strong> of the policy. Most insurers offer a term plans till a <strong>specified age</strong> OR for a <strong>specified number of years</strong> (usually in multiples of 5 or 10).</p>
<p>If the insured event does NOT occur during the policy term, the policy will expire and <strong>NO benefits will be paid at all</strong>. For this reason, term life insurance has the <strong>lowest premiums</strong> among other life insurance plan types with similar coverage.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The most basic term plan is one that only covers Death. It is easy to compare these plans across insurers, which makes it <strong>price competitive</strong>, which is another reason why it tends to be cheaper.</p>
</div>
<p>Term plans are best suited for individuals with financial obligations that only last for a <strong>limited period of time</strong>, such as during a loan repayment or till a child becomes financially independent.</p>
<h2 id="guaranteed-renewability"><strong>Guaranteed Renewability</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#guaranteed-renewability" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Term plans can offer <strong>Guaranteed Renewability</strong>. This allows the policyholder to <strong>renew the term policy at expiration</strong> to provide coverage again for the same duration. It is meant to provide flexibility for insureds with uncertain <strong>long-term financial obligations</strong> or for those with <strong>difficulty affording</strong> long-term coverage at the moment.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Upon renewal, the premiums of the policyholder will increase to reflect the higher mortality due to <strong>age</strong> and the <strong>ultimate mortality</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>Health tends to <strong>deteriorate</strong> with age, thus should the insured want to purchase a new policy after the original, they might be <strong>rejected or priced out</strong>. Guaranteed Renewability overcomes this as it ensures the insured retains their coverage WITHOUT needing to go through medical underwriting.</p>
<p>However, such guaranteed renewability features might result in <strong>Adverse Selection</strong>. <strong>Healthy insured</strong> may instead choose to go through medical underwriting to purchase a new plan at a potentially lower rate; leaving <strong>only unhealthy insureds</strong> in the renewed pool. To combat this, some insurers offer a <strong>re-entry</strong> option  that allows policyholders to voluntarily go through medical underwriting upon renewal to obtain lower premiums, <strong>incentivizing</strong> healthy insured to renew as well.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It is known as re-entry as the policyholder re-enters the <strong>Select Mortality Group</strong> upon renewal.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Only select riders that are attachable to the plan can be renewed on a guaranteed basis.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="yearly-renewable"><strong>Yearly Renewable</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#yearly-renewable" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The most extreme version of renewability is for a plan with a <strong>one year term</strong> that is guaranteed renewable; typically known as <strong>Yearly Renewable Term</strong> (YRT). Pure YRTs are often not sold in practice, but serves as a <strong>baseline</strong> for understanding more complex products.</p>
<p>The premiums for a YRT plan <strong>increase every year</strong>, reflecting the increasing mortality with age. Compared to an otherwise equal traditional level premium term plan, the YRT is <strong>cheaper when young but is significantly more expensive when old</strong>: </p>

<p><img alt="YRT_VS_LEVEL" class="center" src="../Assets/0_TERM_LIFE.md/YRT_VS_LEVEL.png" /></p>
<p>The key difference is that the level premium approach essentially <strong>pre-pays</strong> the premium ahead of time, allowing them to <strong>accumulate with interest</strong> to cover the high mortality costs at later ages, requiring only a reasonably small level premium.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to YRT requires the individual to pay <strong>equal to their mortality cost for that year</strong>. At later ages, most individuals have little to no income, making them unable to afford coverage, forcing them to <strong>lapse the policy when they are most at risk</strong> of death.</p>
<p>In the beginning of life insurance, YRTs were commonly used. However, due to affordability issues, they were phased out in favour of the <strong>smoother level premium</strong> approach that helped with persistency.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The pre-payment of future mortality cost can also be known as "Front Loading" the mortality costs.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="lapse-supportability"><strong>Lapse Supportability</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#lapse-supportability" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>lapse supported</strong> product is one where higher than expected lapses result in higher profitability; the insurer tends to be <strong>better off from lapses</strong>. If policyholders lapse their policy <strong>before the mortality costs increases substantially</strong> above the premium, they have essentially <strong>forfeited their front load</strong> partially or entirely, resulting in <strong>profits for the insurer</strong>.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>The <strong>timing of lapse</strong> is important. Life insurance policies typically have <strong>high acquisition costs</strong>, that are gradually recovered over the life of the policy. If the lapse occurs too early, the insurer would not have recovered these costs and might result in a loss instead.</p>
<p>Thus, when investigating lapse supportability, it is usually the <strong>ultimate lapse rate</strong> that is of interest; shocking the entire lapse rate downwards might see some offsetting effect from lower lapses.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Lapse supportability mainly applies to regular premium products. For single premium or limited premium, <strong>lapse rates should be zero</strong> (in the absence of cash values) once the policy becomes paid-up, preventing any possible lapse profit.</p>
</div>
<p>Lapse supportability is most prevalent in term insurance given that it has <strong>no cash values</strong>; nothing is returned on lapse. The extent of lapse supportability is dependent on the <strong>size of the front load</strong>. <strong>Term-to-100</strong> is the common example of a highly lapse supported product, due to the high mortality costs at the tail end of life that are front loaded.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Lapse supportability still exists for whole life insurance as the <strong>cash values paid are often smaller than the front load</strong>, still resulting in profits to the insurer. The extent is dependent on the relative size of the cash value and the front load.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Lapse supported pricing</strong> refers to <strong>projecting lapses</strong> during pricing, where the insurer <strong>expects to earn lapse profits</strong>. Policies that are projected to lapse are <strong>subsidizing</strong> those that remain in-force, resulting in an overall <strong>lower cost</strong> for the entire portfolio, allowing them to charge <strong>lower premiums</strong>.</p>
<p>The key risk is that this method recognizes profits that have <strong>yet to be earned</strong>. If actual lapse experience emerges (typically much later on) to be <strong>much less than expected</strong>, the profits will never materialize, leading a large <strong>shortfall in reserves</strong>, possibly leading to large losses or insolvency.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, lapse supported premiums tend to be lower, which <strong>increases the perceived value of coverage</strong> which in turn <strong>should lower lapse rates</strong>, working against the  high lapse rates assumed to achieve the lower premiums in the first place.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For whole life policies, non-forfeiture features typically discourage lapses, which drives lapses lower.</p>
<p>Additionally, the presence of the secondary market may drive it even lower than expected. Rather than lapse their policy, policyholders may sell their policy to a third party for higher cash value.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Companies cannot simply assume high lapses during pricing; they need <strong>actual historical experience to back the assumption</strong>. Thus, lapses should not be viewed negatively; some degree of lapse support is necessary to remain competitive.</p>
</div>
<p>Although lapse supportability results in lower premiums, it represents a <strong>conflict of interest</strong> - policyholders aim to retain coverage while insurers gain from lapses. It is generally deemed unethical to design a product that induces lapses. Thus, it is generally viewed as a <strong>taboo topic</strong> among life insurers.</p>
<h2 id="non-level-benefits"><strong>Non-Level Benefits</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#non-level-benefits" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Term plans cans also offer non-level benefits, with the <strong>ability for the benefit to change</strong> over the lifetime of the policy.</p>
<p><strong>Increasing benefits</strong> are suited for invididuals with financial obligations that are <strong>expected to increase</strong> over time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong> will increase the price of goods and services over time</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle inflation</strong> where individuals tend to make more expensive lifestyle choices as their income grows</li>
<li>Parents with kids tend to have <strong>large one-off expenses</strong> due to University or Marriage that occur much later</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>An increasing benefit term policy can be thought of as a combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Level benefit term plan equal to the starting benefit</li>
<li>Level benefit term plan "purchased" each period to account for the increase in coverage</li>
</ol>
<p>For the (2), since the additional coverage is "purchased" each period, it uses the mortality cost at that age, which tends to <strong>increase with age</strong>. It is typically cheaper (on whole) if a level premium term was bought with the final coverage from the very beginning.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Typically, any change to the benefit level made post-inception requires the insured to go through medical underwriting. However, an increasing benefit plan <strong>guarantees</strong> the increase, without the need for medical underwriting.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Decreasing benefits</strong> are suited for individuals with financial obligations that are <strong>expected to decrease</strong> over time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loan balance</strong> decreases over time with each payment</li>
<li>Children <strong>increasingly earn more income</strong> as they enter the workforce, reducing their dependency on parents</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In Singapore, Mortgage Insurance is compulsory when purchasing a HDB, known as the <strong>Home Protection Scheme</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="return-of-premium"><strong>Return of Premium</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#return-of-premium" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Term plans can also offer a <strong>Return of Premium</strong> (ROP), where upon lapsing or expiration the policy, the insured is returned the <strong>total amount of premiums paid till that point</strong>, hence "returning" the premium paid back to them. The feature is typically only available after a specified duration in-force.</p>
<p>This feature is used to <strong>attract customers</strong> who view term insurance as a <strong>waste</strong> as they will not receive any benefit should the insured outlive the policy term. The feature essentially provides a <strong>capital guarantee</strong> on their purchase. It also helps in the <strong>retention</strong> of policyholders as they is <strong>no risk</strong> if they pay premiums; the premium will be returned to them.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>From an ROI perspective, a ROP feature is actually <strong>loss to the policyholder</strong> as they could have earned interest on the amount had they not paid the premiums in first place.</p>
</div>
<p>Life insurance is bought in the unfortunate event that the insured dies during the coverage period. ROP is bought in case the insured survives the coverage period. Thus, ROP as a feature is trying to cover both sides of the mortality-longevity risk. However, if longevity risk is the concern, then it is much better to purchase a <strong>product that specializes in it rather than ROP</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="guaranteed-convertability"><strong>Guaranteed Convertability</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#guaranteed-convertability" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Term plans can also offer the option to convert the term policy into <strong>any type of whole life policy</strong> within a specified time frame. The conversion is guaranteed, <strong>regardless of the health</strong> of the insured at the time of conversion. </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If the resulting whole life plan has <strong>lower coverage</strong> than the existing term plan, the term plan will <strong>continue to be in-force</strong> with the difference in coverage. In this scenario, it is known as a <strong>Partial Conversion</strong>. This ensures <strong>no loss of coverage</strong> during the conversion process.</p>
</div>
<p>It is typically meant for insureds who wanted to purchase a whole life policy but <strong>could not afford</strong> to do so at the time. It could also be purchased by insureds who are <strong>unsure of their future financial obligations</strong>, thus would like the option to be able ti convert.</p>
<p>Convertibility tends to lead to <strong>adverse selection</strong> as insureds who are healthy have the ability to purchase a potentially cheaper whole life policy <strong>from the market</strong>. As a result, some insurers might offer incentives for these healthy individuals to convert, similar to re-entry.</p>
<!-- Embedded option -->

<h2 id="guaranteed-issuanceinsurability"><strong>Guaranteed Issuance/Insurability</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#guaranteed-issuanceinsurability" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Insurers also typically offer <strong>Guaranteed Issue</strong> policies which do NOT require medical underwriting, allowing any individual regardless of their health status to obtain coverage. However, there are typically <strong>restrictions</strong> such as lower coverage limits or waiting periods.</p>
<p>It is typically meant for insureds who have <strong>pre-existing medical conditions</strong> that would otherwise be denied coverage. These plans have already priced in the likely higher mortality thus are <strong>more expensive</strong> than an otherwise non-guaranteed plan with identical coverage.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>GIO is applicable to all forms of life insurance, not just term life. Investment policies may be issued on a guaranteed basis as their benefits are not sensitive to the life of the insured.</p>
</div>
<p>Guaranteed Issuance could also refer to a feature which allows the policyholder to <strong>increase the coverage</strong> of the plan or <strong>purchase a new life insurance plan</strong> without medical underwriting when certain <strong>key life events</strong> occur (EG. Marriage, Child birth, Child Schooling).</p>
<p>It is meant for insureds who are <strong>unsure of their future financial obligations</strong>, allowing them to <strong>add coverage as and when</strong> these milestones that typically increase financial obligations occur.</p>
