# **Insurance Stakeholders**

Overall Workflow
•	Actuaries create insurance policies, determining how much premiums the company will need to charge and how much of those premiums it needs to set aside for related claims
•	Insurance Agents market this policy to prospective clients OR Insurance Brokers with interested clients approach the company to enquire about the policy
•	Underwriters assess the risk of the client and decides on the extent of coverage to offer and how much premium to charge
•	Loss Adjustors are engaged during a claim process to verify the validity of the claim –decide if a pay-out is warranted and if so, how much
•	Other administrative staff are also involved throughout the process

## **Actuaries**

Actuaries
•	Traditional actuarial functions are in Pricing, Reserving/Valuation, Experience Analysis or Financial Reporting of a portfolio of policies
o	In simple terms, Actuaries help to ensure that the enough money is being charged and set aside in adherence to the regulatory environment
•	Non-traditional areas in the more corporate finance/data science side of things are beginning to involve more Actuaries as well – Asset Liability Management, Enterprise Risk Modelling etc
•	We will explore these roles in more detail in a later section

## **Intermediaries**

Intermediaries
o	Agents are sales representatives tied to the company and hence can only sell their companies policies. Each agent is typically limited to a fixed number of insurers they can represent (~3)
o	Brokers are the opposite – they are their own entity and thus are not restricted to just a single company’s policies
o	Agents already have the policies thus their main job is to search for prospective clients. Brokers on the other hand have clients engaging them thus their main job is to search for suitable insurers. Both of them earn via commissions based on the premiums paid in the first few years of the policy
o	They serve an important role to educate their clients on the features and risks of the insurance products. However, insurers are beginning to sell their products directly to customers at lower cost, since they no longer need to pay for commission. 
o	Intermediaries are increasingly getting phased out, but they will still be here to stay for the foreseeable future as more complex products cannot be sold directly

Fee based vs Commission based advisors
Should be incentivised to serve you, not incentivised to sell you



At a basic level, the more people in the pool the better. As an insurer, we want as many Australians as possible to access appropriate cover, which is why ClearView unashamedly supports the commission model.

 
Commissions, as opposed to advice fees paid by the client, make it easier for people to get life insurance advice. It lowers the barriers of entry into the pool.


Some people are not financially capable - the expectation should not be to ask them to get gud
Becuase when our car breaks down, needs legal help ,we dont expect them to do it themselves, they get help
Thus we need to change the system to serving rather than seelling
Thats why FAs are still neededm is just that our system is flawed due to MLM style commissions and lack of regulation
Singaporeans also want cheap things, so thats an issue
Oversupply of FAs makes is hard to seperate wheat from chaff


Sale of insurance depends on trust, even more than manyu opther products because it concerns money in times of need
Startups are inherently poorly positioned to build trust in insurance products because there are doubts about its cashflow and company longevity

Target premium?

Add point on betting

## **Underwriters**

Underwriters
o	As explained earlier, Underwriters are professional risk assessors that determine the risk profile of clients and determine how much premiums to charge them
o	Underwriters use actuarial pricing models as a baseline to calculate the technical premiums and then adjusts this amount based on commercial considerations. The final premium they do end up charging is known as the Actual Premium
o	In simple terms, Actuaries create “pricing bins” according to the different risk profiles available. Underwriters help to screen and sort prospective clients into the correct bin and obtain the corresponding recommended premium
o	For lines of insurance where the risks are homogenous (Life, Personal Lines) or there exists a lot of data, the actuarial pricing models are mostly correct thus the role of the Underwriter’s job is more administrative to verify documents
o	In Life insurance, the risk assessment involves the individuals age and health condition, thus it is called Medical Underwriting
o	For other lines where the risks are non-standard (Commercial Lines, Reinsurance), the actuarial pricing models are less reliable due to limited data, thus Underwriters in these roles are more geared towards the risk assessment and pricing roles

o	Analysis done by a professional third party where necessary
o	Underwriter negotiating with the agent/broker on the above if needed


o	However, they are also more geared towards the commercial side of the business, thus if they feel a risk is worth taking, they could lower prices below recommended amount to increase the odds that the client will take it

Thus, experience is invaluable when it comes to underwriting. Senior underwriters have more control over how much they write, which is known as their Underwriting Authority

## **Risk Engineer**

## **Loss Adjustors**

Loss Adjustors/Claims Assessor
•	They are independent arbitrators that decide IF a claim should be paid out and if so, HOW MUCH should be paid out
•	They are typically (but not necessarily) specialists in a certain field of work (Engineering etc) so that they can give a professional opinion
•	There is an inherent conflict of interest between Insurers and Policyholders. These Loss Adjustors are an important part of the process to assure both parties that the claim decision is unbiased
•	They are typically engaged in non-life insurance where the insured event can be quite complex, but they have been engaged in life insurance as well in areas of fraud or to ensure that the cause of death is legitimate (Not suicide etc)
