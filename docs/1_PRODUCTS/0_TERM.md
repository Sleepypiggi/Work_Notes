# **Term Life Insurance**

## **Overview**

The most basic type of life insurance is known as **Term Insurance**. As its name suggests, it provides an insurance cover ONLY for a **specific timeframe**, known as the **term** of the policy. Most insurers offer a term plans till a **specified age** OR for a specified number of years (usually in multiples of 5 or 10).

If the insured event does NOT occur during the policy term, the policy will expire and **NO benefits will be paid at all**. For this reason, term life insurance has the **lowest premiums** among other life insurance plan types with similar coverage.

!!! Note

    The most basic term plan is one that only covers Death. It is easy to compare these plans across insurers, which makes it **price competitive**, which is another reason why it tends to be cheaper.

Term plans are best suited for individuals with financial obligations that only last for a **limited period of time**, such as during a loan repayment or till a child becomes financially independent.

## **Renewability**

Term plans can offer **Guaranteed Renewability**. This allows the policyholder to **renew the term policy at expiration** to provide coverage again for the same duration. It is meant to provide flexibility for insureds with uncertain **long-term financial obligations** or for those with **difficulty affording** long-term coverage at the moment.

!!! Note

    Upon renewal, the premiums of the policyholder will increase to reflect the higher mortality due to **age** and the **ultimate mortality**.

Health tends to **deteriorate** with age, thus should the insured want to purchase a new policy after the original, they might be **rejected or priced out**. Guaranteed Renewability overcomes this as it ensures the insured retains their coverage WITHOUT needing to go through medical underwriting.

However, such guaranteed renewability features might result in **Adverse Selection**. **Healthy insured** may instead choose to go through medical underwriting to purchase a new plan at a potentially lower rate; leaving **only unhealthy insureds** in the renewed pool. To combat this, some insurers offer a **re-entry** option  that allows policyholders to voluntarily go through medical underwriting upon renewal to obtain lower premiums, **incentivizing** healthy insured to renew as well.

!!! Note

    It is known as re-entry as the policyholder re-enters the **Select Mortality Group** upon renewal.

### **Yearly Renewable**

The most extreme version of renewability is for a plan with a one year term that is guaranteed renewable; typically known as **Yearly Renewable Term** (YRT). Pure YRTs are often not sold in practice, but serves as a baseline for understanding more complex products.

## **Non-Level Benefits**

Term plans typically offer **level benefits** that are **constant** throughout the lifetime of the policy. However, some term plans also offer the **ability for the benefit to change** over the lifetime of the policy.

Increasing benefits are suited for invididuals with financial obligations that are **expected to increase** over time:

* **Inflation** will increase the price of goods and services over time
* **Lifestyle inflation** where individuals tend to make more expensive lifestyle choices as their income grows
* Parents with kids tend to have **large one-off expenses** due to University or Marriage that occur much later

!!! Note

    An increasing benefit term policy can be thought of as a combination of:

    1. Level benefit term plan equal to the starting benefit
    2. Level benefit term plan "purchased" each period to account for the increase in coverage

    The cost of the second component **increases** over time. Depending on the policy structure, it might have been cheaper to purchase a level term with the final desired benefit from the beginning.

!!! Tip

    Typically, any change to the benefit level made post-inception requires the insured to go through medical underwriting. However, an increasing benefit plan **guarantees** the increase, without the need for medical underwriting.

Decreasing benefits are suited for individuals with financial obligations that are **expected to decrease** over time:

* **Loan balance** decreases over time with each payment
* Children **increasingly earn more income** as they enter the workforce, reducing their dependency on parents

!!! Note

    In Singapore, Mortgage Insurance is compulsory when purchasing a HDB, known as the **Home Protection Scheme**.

### **Return of Premium**

Term plans can also offer a **Return of Premium** (ROP), where upon lapsing or expiration the policy, the insured is returned the **total amount of premiums paid till that point**, hence "returning" the premium paid back to them. The feature is typically only available after a specified duration in-force.

This feature is used to **attract customers** who view term insurance as a **waste** as they will not receive any benefit should the insured outlive the policy term. The feature essentially provides a **capital guarantee** on their purchase. It also helps in the **retention** of policyholders as they is no risk if they pay premiums; the premium will be returned to them.

Naturally, the premiums are higher than a regular term policy as there needs to be additional capital used to build up the cash value on top of the regular insurance coverage. More information on cash values will be covered in the permanent insurance subsection.

Unlike a permanent policy, the cash value is **only available after a specified duration or up till a certain age**, usually the end of the policy period. Some ROP policies are also convertible, where the cash value can be transferred into a new permanent policy and continue to accumulate.



### **Waiver of Premium**

### **Convertibility**

Another commonly offered feature is the **option to convert** the term policy into a Permanent policy. The option to convert is only valid for a **specified period**, usually *much shorter* than the policy period.

It is usually meant for insureds who wanted to purchase a permanent policy but **could not afford** to do so at the time or for insureds who suspect that their **circumstances might change** in a way that may require a permanent policy instead.

|        Attained Age Conversion         |            Original Age Conversion             |
| :------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: |
|         Prospective conversion         |             Retroactive conversion             |
| Premiums based on age as at conversion |    Premiums based on age as at original age    |
|  Premium rates as at conversion date   |       Premium rates as at original date        |
|     No additional payment required     | Difference in premiums & interest must be paid |

Insureds might prefer the Original Age conversion as they would get a lower premium and more liberal coverage due to the lower age. However, premium rates have been decreasing over the years, which may make an Attained Age conversion more attractive. Even if the rates were not better, the insured might not have the capital to pay back the premiums and interest, which makes the attained method more attractive.

As with Renewability, the main purpose of this feature is to **guarantee** a conversion to a permanent policy, rather than having to purchase a new permanent policy. For healthy insureds, this option is worthless as they would be indifferent to converting or purchasing a new one - thus, there are usually some **premium incentives** to encourage conversion.

Convertible policies provides an **embedded option** within the policy, which makes it more flexible but have higher premiums as a result.
