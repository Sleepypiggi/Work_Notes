# **Whole Life Insurance**

## **Overview**

The natural progression following a term contract would be one that offers **permanent coverage** throughout their lifetime, known as **Whole Life Insurance**. Since death is **inevitable**, the policy **WILL make a payout** to beneficiaries at some point.

Although the coverage is meant to be for the insured’s entire life, there is an upper limit known as the **Maturity Age** (EG. 100 or 120). If the insured survives till this age, the benefit will be paid out to them.

!!! Note

    The reason is because the insurer expects that all individuals would **die by this age**. In the past, most died by age 100 but due to increasing life expectancy, some have raised their estimates to 120.
    
    The insurer designed the policy with the intent that all individuals will die by this age. Thus, even if the policyholder survives till then, the insurer will make the payout.
    
Whole life insurance is typically suited for individuals who have financial obligations but also want to **leave a bequest** to their beneficiaries.

## **Cash Value**

The defining feature of whole life insurance is that it also offers a guaranteed **Cash Value**. Instead of a death benefit, the insurer can **surrender** (lapse) their policy to obtain the cash value, also known as the **surrender benefit**.

Recall that under a level premium approach, the policyholder pre-pays for their future cost which is then **invested (saved)** to cover future costs. The cash value can thus be thought of as a **savings component** that reflects the above pre-payment.

In practice, the **full amount is not made available** to the policyholder as it accounts for expenses, profits and other considerations. Cash values are typically **low for the first few years** (reflecting new business strain) and gradually increases to be **equal to the death benefit by the maturity age**.

!!! Warning

    Intuitively, cash values can never be higher than the death benefit. If the cash values were higher, the policyholder would gain more from surrendering than keeping the policy in-force, defeating the purpose of the coverage in the first place.
    
!!! Note

    Cash values described above which are low initially are said to be **Front Loaded** because the insurers strain expenses are charged upfront to the cash value.
    
The amount provided is up to the discretion of the insurer. However, certain jurisdictions (such as the US) might have regulation surrounding them.

The intended purpose of cash values was to create a **comprehensive financial product** with both an **insurance and savings component**, allowing it to compete with other savings products in the market. However, it **excels at neither** - it is too expensive as insurance and provides too little ROI as a form of savings.

### **Buy Term Invest the Rest**

Rather than going for a whole life policy that combines both components, better results can be achieved by splitting them up:

* **Insurance Component**: Term Plan
* **Saving/Investment Component**: Index fund or other alternative

Most individuals do NOT truly need insurance coverage for their entire life. At some point, your dependents will grow up and become financially independent. Thus, a term policy can be purchased as a much **lower cost**.

!!! Note

    Apart from the lower cost arising from shorter coverage period, term policies tend to have lower commissions and expenses, which also contribute to the lower premium/poorer results of whole life.

By investing the monies saved from “downgrading” to a term policy, it is likely to generate a **much higher return** than the cash value of the policy that is typically also more **easily accessible**.

However, the returns on a DIY approach are **not guaranteed** and thus prone to external market forces. Additionally, one would need to have the **expertise** to invest and have the **discipline** to routinely do so. Whole life insurance thus provides a **hands off solution**, typically tailored towards the mass market.

!!! Note

    Another interesting perspective is that whole life insurance is also a form of **forced saving** for those who have poor saving habits.

## Reduced Paid Up

## Policy Loan


### **Nonforfeiture Options**

All permanent insurance contracts have a **non-forfeiture** clause which states that the **insured will not forfeit the value** of the policy when the policy is terminated (unlike in Term), which is why they build up cash values to provide an alternative form of value in the policy. Although it is called *Cash* Value, receiving the amount in cash is *not the only way* the value can be passed on to the policyholder.

Another option is that the amount is used as a **Single Premium** to purchase a **Paid Up** *permanent* insurance, usually with **reduced coverage** than the original. This *converts* the policy into a paid up one with reduced coverage, known as **Reduced Paid Up (RPU) Insurance**.

Similarly, the amount can be used as a Single premium to purchase a paid up *Term* Insurance with the **same coverage** with a policy period for **as long as** the cash value can purchase. This extends the coverage of the insured via a term policy, which is why it is known as **Extended Term Insurance**.

If the policyholder lapses the policy, one of the three options will be applied automatically, depending on what the insured specifies beforehand.

### **Loans and Withdrawals**

Another way to access the cash value of the policy is through a **Partial Withdrawal** or **Loan**.

The insured can withdraw a *portion* of their cash value, much like withdrawing funds from a bank account. However, any withdrawal will **also lower death benefit** by the same amount. This is to *prevent* the insured from receiving more than the coverage of the policy.

For instance, assume that the death benefit was 100 and 50 was withdrawn. When the insured dies, they will receive 100 on top of the 50 they already took out, more than the coverage of the policy by the withdrawal amount.

The insurer may also **limit the withdrawals** per year and/or charge an **additional withdrawal fee** (on top of the surrender charge, if any).

> Note that it is called a *Partial* withdrawal because a "Full" withdrawal of the cash value is equivalent to a surrendering the policy. In the same light, it can also be referred to as a *Partial Surrender* of the policy.

Alternatively, the insured can take a Loan from the policy, much like taking a loan from any other financial instituition. Loans can be repaid at any time but the outstanding balance each period earns interest, usually at a rate equal to the rate credited to the cash value.

Unlike a withdrawal, it does not immediately reduce the death/surrender benefit of the policy. However, the policy benefits will be used as **collateral** for the loan - if the insured does not repay the loan balance by the time the policy makes a payout, then the loan balance will be deducted from the benefits.

Note that if the outstanding balance of the loan exceeds the Cash Value of the policy, the insured has a grace Pperiod to make loan repayments, otherwise the policy will **Lapse**.

Most policies also contain an **Automatic Premium Loan (APL)** feature - whereby if the insured has not paid their premiums by the end of the grace period, the policy will automatically take a loan against the cash value of the policy to pay the premium and keep the policy in force.

Whole life insurance can provide a foundation to allow the household to spend more and still be able to provide a bequest, or to increase spending even further by using the cash value as a volatility buffer for the investment portfolio

Although our dependents may become financially independent, most would like to leave a something behind for their children once they are gone, thus they would like to be covered till the very end

Another key reason is that the policyholder only needs to go through Medical Underwriting ONCE. If your health worsens later on in life, it will not negatively affect premiums, and everything will still be covered. Thus, it is good to buy whole life insurance while you are young & healthy
This is in contrast to a case whereby you purchase cheap term insurance for X years, but after X years your health deteriorates, and you would like to renew but it suddenly becomes very expensive
Flexibility comes at a cost
