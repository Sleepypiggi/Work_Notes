### **Nonforfeiture Options**

All permanent insurance contracts have a **non-forfeiture** clause which states that the **insured will not forfeit the value** of the policy when the policy is terminated (unlike in Term), which is why they build up cash values to provide an alternative form of value in the policy. Although it is called *Cash* Value, receiving the amount in cash is *not the only way* the value can be passed on to the policyholder.

Another option is that the amount is used as a **Single Premium** to purchase a **Paid Up** *permanent* insurance, usually with **reduced coverage** than the original. This *converts* the policy into a paid up one with reduced coverage, known as **Reduced Paid Up (RPU) Insurance**.

Similarly, the amount can be used as a Single premium to purchase a paid up *Term* Insurance with the **same coverage** with a policy period for **as long as** the cash value can purchase. This extends the coverage of the insured via a term policy, which is why it is known as **Extended Term Insurance**.

If the policyholder lapses the policy, one of the three options will be applied automatically, depending on what the insured specifies beforehand.

### **Loans and Withdrawals**

Another way to access the cash value of the policy is through a **Partial Withdrawal** or **Loan**.

The insured can withdraw a *portion* of their cash value, much like withdrawing funds from a bank account. However, any withdrawal will **also lower death benefit** by the same amount. This is to *prevent* the insured from receiving more than the coverage of the policy.

For instance, assume that the death benefit was 100 and 50 was withdrawn. When the insured dies, they will receive 100 on top of the 50 they already took out, more than the coverage of the policy by the withdrawal amount.

The insurer may also **limit the withdrawals** per year and/or charge an **additional withdrawal fee** (on top of the surrender charge, if any).

> Note that it is called a *Partial* withdrawal because a "Full" withdrawal of the cash value is equivalent to a surrendering the policy. In the same light, it can also be referred to as a *Partial Surrender* of the policy.

Alternatively, the insured can take a Loan from the policy, much like taking a loan from any other financial instituition. Loans can be repaid at any time but the outstanding balance each period earns interest, usually at a rate equal to the rate credited to the cash value.

Unlike a withdrawal, it does not immediately reduce the death/surrender benefit of the policy. However, the policy benefits will be used as **collateral** for the loan - if the insured does not repay the loan balance by the time the policy makes a payout, then the loan balance will be deducted from the benefits.

Note that if the outstanding balance of the loan exceeds the Cash Value of the policy, the insured has a grace Pperiod to make loan repayments, otherwise the policy will **Lapse**.

Most policies also contain an **Automatic Premium Loan (APL)** feature - whereby if the insured has not paid their premiums by the end of the grace period, the policy will automatically take a loan against the cash value of the policy to pay the premium and keep the policy in force.

Cash value = Reserve?

For investments in the General Account, the insurer earns the difference in investment returns between the amount credited to the cash value and the actual returns

Understanding Cash Value
	The purpose of Cash Value is to reduce the amount of money that the insurer has to pay when you die. You can only get either the Surrender Value or the Death Benefit. If you die, your beneficiaries only get the Death Benefit while the Surrender Value goes to the insurer, which is used to offset the cost of the death benefit to the insurer
	At the beginning of the policy, the Cash Value is low, which means that the risk to the insurer is high. Thus, the premiums mostly go towards paying for the insurance (Mortality charge)
	
Cash Value & New Business Strain
	A more proper way to think about Cash Value is that it is the Net Premium Reserve
	Reserves cover future claims â€“ Death OR Surrender Benefit (Cash Value)
	As alluded to earlier, in the early years of a policy, the premium collected is insufficient to cover Expenses, Insurance Charges and the Regulatory Reserve required
	Insurers thus have to fork out their own capital to fulfil the reserve requirement, immediately taking a loss, known as the New Business Strain
	NBS=Initial Cash Outlow-Cash Inflow
	If the insurer does not have enough capital, writing too much new business can significantly impact their financial standing
	But writing more business also improves long term financial standing
	As more premiums are collected, the reserve will slowly build up and the insurer will recoup their loss & building up Cash Value as well
	Since the reserves are meant to cover future claims, the maximum amount in the reserve is the Death Benefit. Since the Reserve is the Cash Value as well, the Cash Value will never exceed the Death Benefit

Typically lower than total premiums paid

Note that the **surrender benefit must be smaller than the death benefit**, otherwise there would be no reason for the insured to keep the policy as they would earn more by surrendering it.
