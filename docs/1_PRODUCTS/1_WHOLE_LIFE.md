# **Whole Life Insurance**

## **Overview**

The natural progression following a term contract would be one that offers **permanent coverage** throughout their lifetime, known as **Whole Life Insurance**. Since death is **inevitable**, the policy **WILL make a payout** to beneficiaries at some point.

Although the coverage is meant to be for the insured’s entire life, there is an upper limit known as the **Maturity Age** (EG. 100 or 120). If the insured survives till this age, the benefit will be paid out to them.

!!! Note

    The reason is because the insurer expects that all individuals would **die by this age**. In the past, most died by age 100 but due to increasing life expectancy, some have raised their estimates to 120.
    
    The insurer designed the policy with the intent that all individuals will die by this age. Thus, even if the policyholder survives till then, the insurer will make the payout.
    
Whole life insurance is typically suited for individuals who have financial obligations but also want to **leave a bequest** to their beneficiaries.

## **Cash Value**

The defining feature of whole life insurance is that it also offers a guaranteed **Cash Value**. Instead of a death benefit, the insurer can **surrender** (lapse) their policy to obtain the cash value, also known as the **surrender benefit**.

Recall that under a level premium approach, the policyholder pre-pays for their future cost which is then **invested (saved)** to cover future costs. The cash value can thus be thought of as a **savings component** that reflects the above pre-payment. In practice, the **full amount is not made available** to the policyholder as it accounts for expenses, profits and other considerations, based on the **discretion of the insurer** (subject to any regulations). Cash values are typically **low for the first few years** (reflecting new business strain) and gradually increases to be **equal to the death benefit by the maturity age**.

!!! Warning

    Intuitively, cash values can never be higher than the death benefit. If the cash values were higher, the policyholder would gain more from surrendering than keeping the policy in-force, defeating the purpose of the coverage in the first place.
    
!!! Note

    Cash values described above which are low initially are said to be **Front Loaded** because the insurers strain expenses are charged upfront to the cash value.

The intended purpose of cash values was to create a **comprehensive financial product** with both an **insurance and savings component**, allowing it to compete with other savings products in the market. However, it **excels at neither** - it is too expensive as insurance and provides too little ROI as a form of savings.

### **Buy Term Invest the Rest**

Rather than going for a whole life policy that combines both components, better results can be achieved by splitting them up:

* **Insurance Component**: Term Plan
* **Saving/Investment Component**: Index fund or other alternative

Most individuals do NOT truly need insurance coverage for their entire life. At some point, your dependents will grow up and become financially independent. Thus, a term policy can be purchased as a much **lower cost**.

!!! Note

    Apart from the lower cost arising from shorter coverage period, term policies tend to have lower commissions and expenses, which also contribute to the lower premium/poorer results of whole life.

By investing the monies saved from “downgrading” to a term policy, it is likely to generate a **much higher return** than the cash value of the policy that is typically also more **easily accessible**. However, the returns on a DIY approach are **not guaranteed** and thus prone to external market forces. Additionally, one would need to have the **expertise** to invest and have the **discipline** to routinely do so. Whole life insurance thus provides a **hands off solution**, typically tailored towards the mass market.

!!! Note

    Although BTIR is mathematically superior, some may still opt for whole life or its variants as it is a form of forced saving/investment.
    
    Additionally, not all individuals understand capital markets and would rather let a financial institution (insurer) handle the investments.

The key advantage of whole life insurance is that the insured only needs to go through **medical underwriting once**, and the rates are locked in at the time of purchase. Regardless of how the health of the insured deteriorates, the policy will remain in-force at the same premium rate. This is in contrast to purchasing term insurance and then renewing it later in life, where the premium rates would increase substantially. Naturally, this privilege is **unfortunately only available to those who can afford the high cost of whole life insurance** at a young age.

### **Policy Loan**

Another way that the cash value can be "accessed" is via a **Policy Loan**. The policyholder can take a loan from the insurer **up to the cash value** of the policy at the time. The policy benefits are used as **collateral** for the loan. Thus, any **oustanding balance will be deducted** at the time of any payout.

!!! Warning

    If the outstanding balance of the loan **exceeds the cash value** of the policy, the policyholder will be notified to make loan repayments. Failing to do so within a grace period will result in the termination of the policy.

The key idea was to provide an alternative method of **accessing their cash value** in times of financial stress, **rather than a full lapse** of the policy, while still maintaining their coverage level. However, some argue that the prospect of having to pay regular premiums and the loan interest may cause policyholders to abandon the policy all together, resulting in lapses.

!!! Tip

    Modern studies of policy loans found that there are several theories for policy loan take up rate:

    * **Emergency Fund**: To cover short-term financial shocks
    * **Interest Abitrage**: To make arbitrage between policy loan rates and market interest rates
    * **Alternative Funding**: To use an an alternate source of credit when others are used up or not available

!!! Note

    If the policy loan take up rate is too high, insurers would have to keep a significant amount of their assets in relatively liquid investments with low yields, limiting their return.

### **Partial Surrender**

Another way to access the cash value of the policy is through a **Partial Surrender**. The policyholder can **withdraw a portion of their cash value** (subject to certain limits and charges) which also **lowers the benefit** of the policy by the same amount. This is to prevent the policyholder from receiving more than the original coverage of the policy.

!!! Note

    This feature is sometimes known as a **Partial Withdrawal**. Partial surrender better reflects that the policy benefit is reduced as well; surrendering part of the policy.

Given that the policy benefit is reduced, the **subsequent premiums are reduced** as well to reflect the reduced coverage. Thus, this feature is to help policyholders who foresee an **extended period of financial shocks** such that they would need to reduce their premium commitments. This still allows them to retain lower coverage at a more affordable cost.

## **Non-Forfeiture**

Whole life insurance is designed around **non-forfeiture**, where the policyholder will not forfeit the full value of the policy upon non-payment (lapsing). Cash values themselves are a form of non-forfeiture benefit as they are given to the policyholder upon lapse.

### **Reduced Paid Up**

Rather than taking the cash value as cash, it can be used as a **single premium** to purchase a whole life policy with **lower coverage**. This process essentially converts the existing whole life policy into a paid-up one with reduced coverage, hence is commonly known as **Reduced Paid Up** (RPU) Insurance. Once executed, the policy cannot be reverted its original state.

This feature is mainly for those who **do not have an immediate need for cash** but would still like to retain a **low level of permanent coverage**.

### **Extended Term Insurance**

Similarly, the amount can also be used as a single premium to purchase **term insurance** with the same coverage, for as long as the amount can afford to. This extends the coverage of the existing whole life policy, hence is commonly known as **Extended Term Insurance**.  Once executed, the policy cannot be reverted its original state.

This feature is mainly for those who **do not have an immediate need for cash** but would still like to retain the **same coverage for only the near future**.

### **Automatic Premium Loan**

Notice that the above features require explicit instruction from the policyholder. For most insurers, if no explicit instructions are given, the **Automatic Premium Loan** (APL) feature of the policy will activate. As its name suggests, the policy will **automatically take a loan** to cover the premium cost.

Due to the high interest on the loans, if left untouched, the APL will quickly deplete the cash value, causing the policy to terminate.
