Free Look Period:
After purchasing a life insurance policy, you have a 14-day free-look period - starting from the day you receive your
policy documents to review the documents carefully. During this time, if you choose to cancel your policy, we will
refund you the premiums you have paid (without interest), less any medical fees and other expenses, such as
payments for medical check-ups and medical reports, incurred by us.
If we make your policy document and all other documents from us available electronically via PRUaccess, we
consider they have been delivered and received when you receive the relevant SMS or email telling you that the
documents are accessible on PRUaccess. Otherwise, we consider your policy and all other documents from us as
delivered and received seven days from the date of posting to the last-known address you gave us.
If you decide this policy is not suitable for your needs, simply write to us within the 14-day free-look period.

Direct Purchase Insurance (DPI)
	To respond to this demand, Insurers now sell basic term and whole life policies DIRECTLY to the consumer (No intermediary)
	Since no financial advice was given, no commission is charged and thus premiums are lower compared to policies of similar nature
	These policies typically have very standardized features and often come with the option to add a Total Permanent Disability (TPD) or Critical Illness (CI) rider
	CompareFirst is a joint effort between various organizations to provide a platform to easily compare all sorts of insurance products, especially DPIs

## Central Provident  Fund Lifelong Income For Eldery (CPF LIFE)

CPF is a mandatory savings scheme for ALL working Singaporeans and Permanent Residents.

•	Mandatory pension scheme for all Singapore Residents provided by the government
•	Hybrid of an Annuity and Life Insurance – Provides periodic payments till a certain age AND a bequest (Lump sum of money) to dependents upon death
•	All Singapore residents are required to contribute 20% of their income towards CPF while their employer contributes another 17% on top of it
•	This will be split into three separate accounts – Ordinary Account (OA), Special Account (SA) and Medisave Account (MA)
•	Upon hitting 55, the OA and SA will be merged to form the Retirement Account (RA). Part of the amount will then be used to contribute towards an Annuity Fund (AF). Another contribution to the AF from RA will be made right before the payments start
•	Upon death, the remaining amount in the RA and the AF will be bequest to the dependents of the individual
•	The individual has to choose between 1 of 3 annuity plans at age 55:
o	Basic Plan → Smaller payments but larger bequest
o	Standard Plan → Larger payments but smaller bequest
o	Enhanced Plan → TBC
o	There are some other minimum requirements for each plan as well as some differing mechanisms (How much premium is drawn from the RA etc)
•	The key difference between CPF LIFE and a privately provided annuity is that the Individual bears ALL the risk. CPF as the sole administrator bears no risk and in fact enjoys significant economies of scale:
o	Inflation risk → Payments provided are not inflation protected
o	Interest Rate Risk → Rates provided are not guaranteed (Subject to market)
o	Longevity Risk → Payments till a fixed age only, no support past that age
