Endowment selling
Buy for more than the surrender value
The new owner takes on responsibility for future premium payments and collects the maturity value when the policy matures or the death benefit when the original life assured dies. Policyholders who sell their policies no longer benefit from the life cover and should consider whether to take out alternative cover.
Investors will pay more than the surrender value because the policy has greater value if it is kept in force than if it is terminated early. 

Endowment Insurance is a **Savings Oriented** permanent insurance policy but with a **limited policy period**, similar to term insurance. As its name suggests, the *primary* goal of Endowment Insurance is for the policy to Endow and provide a payout to the insured, which is why the policy period is limited. They are typically **participating** policies.

To compete with other similar savings products (Fixed Deposit etc), the amount paid into the policy must be *at least* the amount paid out, providing a **Capital Guarantee**. Thus, the SA of the policy is the **Savings Goal** chosen by the insured and is usually equal to the **sum of all premiums paid over the life of the policy**.

> The savings goal is the amount the insured wishes to *save*. Thus, the premiums paid over the life of the policy must be equal to this amount, akin to saving in a bank account to meet a target.

Unlike other policies, the death benefit is *NOT equal* to the SA. The death benefit is usually some function (~105%) of the total premiums paid *up till that point*, providing a capital guarantee as well.

The maturity benefit of the policy is usually the sum of the **SA and participating dividends**. The "interest" earned on the product is largely dependent on the performance of the participating fund.

<!-- Not all endowments are like this, SA could be lower but more NGTD benefits -->

### **Endowment**

Endowment Insurance offers coverage for a **fixed period** but also has a **cash value** component. It is intended to be a **saving oriented product** with limited insurance coverage.

The intended goal is for the policy to mature and payout the maturity benefit, which can be used to fund specific financial goals at known points in time such as funding education expenses or purchasing a home.

In Singapore, they typically come in one of two variations:
