### **Critical Illness Insurance**

Critical Illness (CI) Insurance is a contract whereby the insurer will pay out a benefit to the **policyholder** if they become diagnosed with a qualifying **critical illness**.

In Singapore, there are a list of **37 CIs with a standardized definition** across the industry. Insurers are then free to provide coverage for addittional CIs based on their own definitions.

Individuals who become diagnosed with critical illness typically become **unable to work** as they require treatment. Thus, CI insurance similarly provides **Income Replacement** and **Debt Repayment** coverage for the beneficiaries of the insured during the downtime.

Similar to TPD, CI insurance can cover **out of pocket expenses** that are **not covered by health insurance**:

* **Medical Expenses**: Alternative therapies for rare variations of illness
* **Non-Medical Expenses**: Cost of transport & accomodation for out of town treatments

!!! Warning

	It is a common misconception that CI insurance is needed to cover the cost of treatment - that should be covered by health insurance.

	However, due to the ever evolving nature of CI and medical technology, some **rare diseases** or **new treatments** might not be covered by health insurance.
