
### **Life Annuities**

A Life Annuity is a contract whereby the insurer will make **routine payments** to the insured for as long as they are alive during the payment period.

Individuals who **live longer than expected** might not have sufficient financial resources to survive. Thus, the annuity payments are meant to **cover essential living expenses**, ensuring the insured is able to age gracefully.

!!! Info

	Life annuities are the natural complements to life insurance - one hedges the risk of dying too early while the other against the risk of dying too late.

## How do Annuities work?

Policyholders must first decide *when* they would like to start receiving for payments and for *how long*. The date they start receiving payments is known as the **Maturity Date** while the period between the point of purchase till maturity is the **Accumulation Period**.

Policyholders will pay premiums during the accumulation period, where they will then be invested in a fund. The value of the fund on the maturity date is known as the **Accumulation Value**.

Based on the accumulation value, the policy will then determine how much to pay out per month such that the fund value will be fully exhausted during the payment period.

Thus, annuities are generally known as **Savings products** as policyholders will contribute to the Annuity fund periodically to receive later withdraw from it.

They are typically (but not exclusively) used for retirement in the form of a *pension* where policyholders will make regular contributions to the fund while working and receive monthly payouts starting from retirement.

This is where most people can only speak theoretically at least for those who still not old enough to physically experience or be cognisant to changes in interest rates. And maybe investment environment completely different as it wasn’t as accessible as it is today.

Since 2009/10, interest rates have been low. Prior to that it is much higher that’s why no mad rush for private properties, because hdb loan rates better than bank loans.

Hence that’s why in 2011/12, we have a tiny “housing bubble” that cooling measures must be introduced.

Either way, the RM definitely talking out of his/her league when she says that about things going south. This is where I don’t like. Nothing will ever go wrong, it’s so safe, etc. but people still got rug pulled by hyflux/Lehman brothers
