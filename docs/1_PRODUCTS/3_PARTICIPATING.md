## **Participating**

### **Guaranteed & Non-Guaranteed Elements**

**Non-Guaranteed Elements (NGE)** are benefits or charges in the policy that are not fixed and can thus be changed at the **discretion of the insurer**, depending on *expectations about future experience*. For instance, the credited interest rate and expenses are typically non-guaranteed elements as they depend on market conditions at the time.

However, insurers also provide **Guaranteed Elements** in the policy to limit the variance of the NGE. This comes in the form of guaranteed **minimum benefits** or **maximum charges** for the non-guaranteed elements. The insurer has the discretion to change the NGE within the bounds of their guarantees.

These non-guaranteed elements allows the insured to **share the experience** of the insurer, which may allow them to be better off compared to an otherwise all guaranteed policy.

### Policyholder Reasonable Expectation

Projecting the maximum illustrated assumed interest rates (generally, 12%), using current (or assumed) administrative expenses and current costs of insurance, without showing the prospective client several other assumed rates of return, creating a Blue Sky problem.

The divisible surplus will then be **split among all par policies** in an equitable way, depending on how much they contributed to the surplus. The mechanics of this split will be covered in the section on In Force Management.

Naturally, dividends are a **NGE** as they are dependent on the *past experience* of the insurer. Despite being non-guaranteed, insureds often feel cheated if what they receive is **significantly different** from what was advertised on the policy illustration. While the insurers were not at fault, this has caused reputational issues in the past thus it is in the insurers best interest to payout dividends at a rate **close to what was advertised**.

Insurers accomplish this by **smoothing** the dividends over time, avoiding large fluctuations. When the surplus is above the advertised rate, the excess may be held back to compensate for potential years where the surplus falls short.

A participating policy (**par policy**) is one that **participates profit sharing**, making them entitled to a portion of the insurers profits, known as **Dividends/Bonus**. The proportion of profits that must be distributed is known as the **Divisible Surplus**, which is dependent on regulation. In Singapore, the ratio is 9:1 - for every $9 given to insureds, the insurer is able to take $1 as profit.

<!-- Add point on why they must share the profits - it was the insureds capital? -->



The Dividend can then be passed on to the insurer in one of a few ways:

* **Cash** - Paid to the policyholder
* **Premium Reduction** - Offsets the premiums for the period/future periods
* **Accumulate at Interest** - Held with the insurer and earns compound interest; value is added to the benefit of the policy
* **Purchase Paid Up Additions (PUA)** - Used as a single premium to purchase as much paid up permanent insurance as it can, adding to the overall coverage of the policy; PUAs can be par, allowing them to **earn additional dividends**

In Singapore, most dividends **accumulate at interest** with the insurer. It usually comes in two components:

* **Reversionary Bonus (RB)** - Credited annually to the insured at a rate based on the SA of the policy. Most policies also allow it to compound; allowing previously earned bonuses to earn interest as well.
* **Terminal Bonus (TB)** - *Residual surplus* left after all reversionary bonuses have been paid. It is paid out as a **lump sum** when the policy terminates, on top of the Death/Surrender/Maturity benefit as a percentage of the SA.

The amount of any terminal
bonus payable depends on how long you have had your
policy
percentage of the accumulated reversionary bonus

Most non-par policies contain other NGEs apart from dividends, thus there is no need to purchase a par policy to share the experience of the insurer. Dividends are just an additional layer of NGEs that can be opted into.

<!--The life insurance manual defines policy dividends as refunds of premium over-payments. They are therefore not exactly like corporate stock dividends, which are payouts of net income from total revenues.
