## **Participating**

A **Participating Policy** is one that **participates in profit sharing** with the insurer. As such, they are also commonly referred to as a "With-Profits" policy.

The premiums from all participating policies are pooled together into a **Participating Fund** managed by the insurer. The fund is used to support the operations of the policies (expenses and benefits), where the remaining balance is invested with the goal of generating **stable long-term returns**.

Every year, the health of the participating fund is measured based on its ability to support future benefit payments and profit sharing. The excess can be understood as the "Profit" of the participating fund, which is shared with policyholders in the form of a **Bonus**.

Bonuses are often referred to as **Non-Guaranteed** benefits as the performance of the participating fund is not guaranteed.

The key selling point of a participating policy is that there are **limited downside risks**:

* Guaranteed benefits will be received **regardless** of the performance of the par fund
* Declared bonuses are guaranteed and will be received **regardless of the future performance** of the par fund
* Bonus declaration can only be positive; losses are NOT shared

### **Guaranteed & Non-Guaranteed Elements**

**Non-Guaranteed Elements (NGE)** are benefits or charges in the policy that are not fixed and can thus be changed at the **discretion of the insurer**, depending on *expectations about future experience*. For instance, the credited interest rate and expenses are typically non-guaranteed elements as they depend on market conditions at the time.

However, insurers also provide **Guaranteed Elements** in the policy to limit the variance of the NGE. This comes in the form of guaranteed **minimum benefits** or **maximum charges** for the non-guaranteed elements. The insurer has the discretion to change the NGE within the bounds of their guarantees.

These non-guaranteed elements allows the insured to **share the experience** of the insurer, which may allow them to be better off compared to an otherwise all guaranteed policy.

### Policyholder Reasonable Expectation

Projecting the maximum illustrated assumed interest rates (generally, 12%), using current (or assumed) administrative expenses and current costs of insurance, without showing the prospective client several other assumed rates of return, creating a Blue Sky problem.

The divisible surplus will then be **split among all par policies** in an equitable way, depending on how much they contributed to the surplus. The mechanics of this split will be covered in the section on In Force Management.

Naturally, dividends are a **NGE** as they are dependent on the *past experience* of the insurer. Despite being non-guaranteed, insureds often feel cheated if what they receive is **significantly different** from what was advertised on the policy illustration. While the insurers were not at fault, this has caused reputational issues in the past thus it is in the insurers best interest to payout dividends at a rate **close to what was advertised**.

Insurers accomplish this by **smoothing** the dividends over time, avoiding large fluctuations. When the surplus is above the advertised rate, the excess may be held back to compensate for potential years where the surplus falls short.

A participating policy (**par policy**) is one that **participates profit sharing**, making them entitled to a portion of the insurers profits, known as **Dividends/Bonus**. The proportion of profits that must be distributed is known as the **Divisible Surplus**, which is dependent on regulation. In Singapore, the ratio is 9:1 - for every $9 given to insureds, the insurer is able to take $1 as profit.

<!-- Add point on why they must share the profits - it was the insureds capital? -->



The Dividend can then be passed on to the insurer in one of a few ways:

* **Cash** - Paid to the policyholder
* **Premium Reduction** - Offsets the premiums for the period/future periods
* **Accumulate at Interest** - Held with the insurer and earns compound interest; value is added to the benefit of the policy
* **Purchase Paid Up Additions (PUA)** - Used as a single premium to purchase as much paid up permanent insurance as it can, adding to the overall coverage of the policy; PUAs can be par, allowing them to **earn additional dividends**

In Singapore, most dividends **accumulate at interest** with the insurer. It usually comes in two components:

* **Reversionary Bonus (RB)** - Credited annually to the insured at a rate based on the SA of the policy. Most policies also allow it to compound; allowing previously earned bonuses to earn interest as well.
* **Terminal Bonus (TB)** - *Residual surplus* left after all reversionary bonuses have been paid. It is paid out as a **lump sum** when the policy terminates, on top of the Death/Surrender/Maturity benefit as a percentage of the SA.

The amount of any terminal
bonus payable depends on how long you have had your
policy
percentage of the accumulated reversionary bonus

Most non-par policies contain other NGEs apart from dividends, thus there is no need to purchase a par policy to share the experience of the insurer. Dividends are just an additional layer of NGEs that can be opted into.

<!--The life insurance manual defines policy dividends as refunds of premium over-payments. They are therefore not exactly like corporate stock dividends, which are payouts of net income from total revenues. 

Par illustration is 3 and 4.25% but do not represent the upper and lower limits of the fund
Bonuses can also be surrendered

BSR = Bonus Supported Rate
Investment Return needed to support the current bonus assumptions

Compare against the current BEIR assumption to determine if the bonus rate is sustainable

Usually within some limit (+-1) of the BEIR is reasonable, no need to change

BSR is used to drive Bonus related decisions

Singapore is very relaxed in terms of bonus regulations > Companies given a lot of leeway on what to do (Ofher regulations may prescribed more rules or actions needed)

SG generally has two extreme ends

1\ Don’t react approach (over smoothing)
- Idea is that there is economic cycle (Go up will eventually go down)
- During times of up save the difference so that can pay out in times of bad
- Good because stable
- Risk is that there is a prolonged period of bad times, exhausts previous savings and causing a problem

2\ Active approach
- Raise and cut bonus based on the economic cycle
- Risk is customer backlash due to constant fluctuation
- Good because no risk of eating losses like the over conservative approach

Another question is the scope of policies to cut - You can cut the whole portfolio or a subset of the portfolio (EG Maturing policies)

If you make medium size changes each year, then year on year the movement is relatively small

But if make small changes each year only, then if shit hits the fan will have to make big changes
Bonus setting very much an art due to the flexibility

PRE is usually benchmarked against what we share with the PH in the prod spec

As well as what the other competitors are doing

If everyone is having a good year, cannot be that only our company is having a bad year

Logic is that given the size of the par fund, there are only so few investment options - there is still a range of outcomes but largely remains the same

Bad optics if only we raise or cut, try not to stand out

Important to have intel from other companies whether or not they cutting

PAR FUND

Estate is the portion of the par fund that does not belong to any specific policyholder.

Measure of the size of the par fund = Policy Assets

Par Fund Attributable to Policyholder = Asset Share

Estate = PA - AS

MAS does not use the word “estate” in their regulation. Thus, Income also doesn’t use the word estate. The “Estate” is referred to as “Buffer”.

MAS doesn’t care whether you have an estate, all they care about is the health of the Par Fund, whether PA > PL.

Under SG regulation, no point having an Estate because the only way that Shareholder can extract money from the par fund is via Shareholder Transfer, no other mechanism.

Thus, keep Estate also no point - just declare to policyholder.

Asset Share is used to determine how much bonus to declare. Thus, some companies will gross up the Asset Share to the Estate amount, effectively zerozing the estate.

Other regulations not as strict, allow for withdrawal of some part or all of the estate, which is why it is a concept for them.

In SG context, do not confuse with Surplus >> Refers to the surplus account of the par fund

Why have estate?

1/ Non Par products written inside par fund, the profits generated from these products will flow to the estate

2/ Imperfection - calculation error/dont pay exactly what they should be getting, slowly built up over time

Par fund is designed such that early exit is better for par fund

Partial decrement concept
Accelerating

Par reserve =/= Par MCL

Par Reserve = PL
PL = BEL @ BEIR + PLSHTRAN + PL SHTAX

Policy loan cannot be lower than Par BEIR
because cannot have subsidise the policy loaners

Cash Bonus and RB is competing
PAR Reserve for NBEV is PL, not MCL

Bonus principle is one year/current year.

But important to look at future years. Now ok, but in future gor problem.

Better to make some small change now (even though technically not required) rather than major change in following years

Same for all management decisions

GPV/AS is equivalent to BSR = BEIR

Careful about calibration

Is the 80% or 120% ratio equivalent to BSR 1/-1

Coverage unit >> Maximum amount that can be claimed in that period

Policyholder Tax Par Fund

Par Fund idea is that the insurer earns profit on behalf of the policyholder, which is distributed in the form of bonus

Income for PH which is why it needs to be taxed

The bonus declared is net of tax; policyholder no need declare this income on their (prevent double counting)

The tax on this amount is lower (10% vs 17%) to reflect that it is for consumer not corporations

10% is on average what consumers pay; flat 10% is easier to adminster

Two transfers
1\ Transfer based on nett of tax declaration
2\ Transfer for tax

Functionally is equivalent to gross of tax declaration, but the operation is that there are two transfers

Transfer = Cost of Bonus * 1/9

Cost of Bonus reflects the cost incurred by the company to adminster the bonus

For Cash Bonus and TB, it is a direct payment thus the COB = Bonus Amount

For RB, the amount is added to the coverage of the policy.
The Cost of RB is the PV of the cashflows arising from this bonus declaration

Cost of RB = Reserve After Declaration - Reserve Before Declaration

Note that once the rb is declared it becomes vested, so COB in subsequent times must reflect this; cannot just take EPV of bonus cashflow

Intuitively think in terms of P&L
Declare Cash Bonus & TB, immediately hit P&L by that amount
Declare RB, hit P&L by the increase in reserve

So the Cost of RB declaration is technically lower than the nominal RB amount (unlike CB/TB where they are equal)

Ultimately it is fair as the transfer is based on what is truly incurred

Death surrender got different proportion of RB/TB, surrender usually less

BSR

Asset Share as at today = EPV(Future Cashflows only, excl investment income)

BSR = IRR (Cashflows)

How much investment return I need to exactly sustain future cashflows

Asset Share = precious asset share + cashflows + inv income - ph tax

Bottom up asset share might not equal to policy assets due to the imperfects in asset share calculation or because got other policy

Key idea is that any unallocayed surplus needs to be reallocated to the policies within the same group, so we need to gross up the asset shares

Cashflow no reserve no interest no capital etc

MCL = Guaranteed only
PL = Gtd + Ngtd + SHTRAN rsv+ Tax rsv

Policy don’t just need to pay the benefits + bonu, need pay bonus + tax as well

Not common to hold PAD for PL, can cut future bonus to offset adverse experience if needed

Allowed under SAS L02

Interim RB = Rb to declared at the end of year

Accrued RB = Declared RB + Interim

Residual profit is sort of your projected estate

Whereas your current estate is your current estate

Not supposed to have estate

Estate belongs to all policyholders

Income defends by saying this buffer is temporary


In model projection, declared bonus is already the 90 portion
Gross and Net
Gross > Never minus
Net > Minus
Usually used in a Tax context
Profit minus transfer
Difference between Par and Non Par is that the resprof earns interest, and can only take 1/9


Upon becoming paid up, the policy is non par, no need pay premiums anymore
Customer like RB cos vested but company prefer TB cos nongtd

Transfer is done yearly
Total cost of bonus for that year
Resets each year
Cost of bonus = cost for the company, how much increase in liability did the company do

MAS320

Expense allocation to Par Fund must be fair and reasonable

Directly related to Par Fund or agents selling par fund

Special payments made to a select group of agents cannot be allocated to par fund

There are two conditions for Par Fund Solvency:
Policy Assets  > Policy Liabilities
Par FSR > 100%

If PAR FSR below 100%, no need to inject capital into the gated par fund, can just reallocate within the SH Fund to more money in the Surplus account

Once inject capital into Ring Gated Par fund, will lose money
- Whenever capital injected, there is a provision to recover that amount later
- For Par Fund, only allowed to recover exactly that amount (lose interest earned on that)
Ring Gated Mechanics
Par Reserve is the higher of
MCL, PA & BEL

Usually PA is the highest.
Any investment return earned by the Par Fund will flow into PA, which will lead to increase in reserve by the same amount
Thus, from P&L perspective no net change on total company level
Thus, any change to Par Fund generally wont hit P&L because there is auto-balancing mechanism
Main consideration for Par Fund is always will the change impact the ability to pay out bonus » Require management action etc

MAS320

Everyone in the same channel, for things they are paid the same, can charge to par fund

But if you favour a certain group, that cannot be charged to par fund

Cash bonus is paid BOM

# Asset Share

The asset share is effectively the accumulated of premiums with investment returns less any deductions.

The asset share of a policy in force is the share of the insurer's assets attributable to that policy. Here, expenses, interest, mortality and so forth are calculated based on the insurer's experience for similar policies over the period.

Asset shares define the notion of how quickly a policy builds policy values (assets) and hence profits.


The Asset Share represents the retrospective accumulation of premiums, investment return, claims payments for regular withdrawals and part surrenders, and the charges payable by the policyholder as specified by the policy terms and conditions.
Asset share is the value which the company holds till date i.e. the actual deposits in respect of a policy. However, (Prospective) Reserves are something which the company should hold to meet all its liabilities.

Asset shares directly depends on what has actually happened in the past (ignoring any smoothing, adjustments) whereas Reserves are something which is based on the assumptions about the future and will largely depend on the actuary's views about the future.

Reserves are targetted to meet just the benefit payments over time, so if everything happens as assumed, reserves will be equal to zero at the end of the term whereas the asset share would be greater than zero, the remainder representing the profits to the company.

The payout on WP contracts is often the smoothed asset share. The terminal bonus is effectively the balancing item to achieve this.

Given that we are aiming to pay out approximately the asset share, we need to make sure that the regular bonuses aren't too large, ie we don't want the guarantees to be bigger than the asset share at maturity. One way to achieve this is to set regular bonuses equal to the bonus earning capacity (BEC). To calculate the BEC we project the asset share to maturity (today's asset share plus premiums less cost of claims less expenses plus investment return) and equate it to the payout (current guarantees plus future regular bonuses plus an allowance for terminal bonus). The BEC is the rate of regular bonus that ensures equality betwee the projected asset share and the projected benefits.

1. Asset shares are fundamental to the way that with-profits works, but you're right that they are much less useful for without-profits. However, the difference between the asset share and the payout is one way to measure the profit made on the contract.

Asset Share is essentially the cumulative actual profits of a policy, retrospectively based on actual experience
It can be calculated for all kinds of products, but it is mostly used with Par Products

Par Product Crash Course
- all Par policies are written inside the Par fund, owned by the policyholders
- If the policy assets are larger than liabilities, this is known as Par fund Surplus/Estate
- the insurer must declare how much of the Surplus that They want to declare as Bonus
- Within the declared amount, the amount must be shared between policyholders and shareholder In a 10:90 split
- the amount of Bonus is non-guaranteed each period, but Insurers try NOT to deviate too much from what was advertised (Bonus Smoothing) to avoid customer backlash, as well as for stability
- as such, NOT all the Surplus is declared as Bonus, Some of it is held back as a buffer for bad times etc
-- Once declared, the bonus is considered guaranteed ("Vested"), which increases MCL, risk requirement etc
--- Reversionary

Asset share has its own set of assumptions - Why? Does it represent actual? No right

There are two methods for Asset Share:
* Rolling Method: Take the actual AS for the year and roll it one year forward
* Backcasted Method: Project the AS for all previous years

Income does the backcasted method. Rightfully, it should represent the actual experience for each year. However, only the INV return represents the actual. All other assumptions are as at BE

Since Income does not use the actual experience, we will gross up the total asset share to the true asset share amount, that is tracked by FN/other departments. Problem is that they need to know the AS at the product level to set bonuses

This gross up/gross down amount is weighted based on the preliminary asset share calculated and distributed to each product. Then that is the final true asset share amount

Asset share is the share of the insurer's assets attributable to that policy
It is similar to reserve but is different
Reserve/Liability represents the amount that the insurer needs to have
Asset share represents the amount that the insurer actually has

Asset Share should equal to the Policy Assets

Estate > Does not belong to any policyholder in the par fund
PA-PL > Should be close to each other?

PL is used as a proxy to the amount of assets belonging to policyholders
However, the true amount is closer to asset share

Regulation: PA > PL

MAS i > SG regulation say Par fund should not have estate, they dont like the word estate
They dont like estate, because UK play a lot of pattern with it to distribute?
Theres no estate under RBC2

If you cut bonus because not enough surplus, how tf u have estate?

PA - PL > Buffer, proxy for estate

with-profits estate (the inherited estate is the expression used to describe surplus assets in the with-profits fund) is typically built up from transfers of small charges on the premiums from existing and matured with-profits policies (or from their maturity pay-outs) and from surpluses on non-profit business

If policyholders with different types of financial guarantee are all to be treated fairly and the conflict of interest between shareholders, existing and new policyholders is to be managed fairly, then an estate is necessary.

The asset share is effectively the accumulated of premiums with investment returns less any deductions.

estate (usually understand it as undistributed surplus or asset less liabilities) 
he estate is normally defined as the assets minus the realistic liabilities

 'free surplus' (or 'estate') as assets minus asset shares,

Similar to other Insurance Funds, there may be excess assets allocated to support the Participating Fund’s business over and above that required to meet projected policyholder benefits. For the Participating Fund, these excess assets are referred to as the **fund’s buffer**. 

►

Buffer is therefore adjusted by compounding it at the Best Estimate (“BE”) Participating Fund Yield (“PFY”) to an assumed run-off date before (120 years) and discounting it back to the valuation date at the RDR. This implicitly assumes that the buffer will only be distributed when all business written in the Participating Fund run off.

This implicitly assumes that the buffer will only be distributed when all business written in the Participating Fund run off.

Estate Projection
Current surplus = adjusted buffer after tax
Assume business run off after some time  (EG 120 years)
Assume buffer will grow at the FER and will continue to pay bonus during this period with no new business (run off)
PV the amount back to the current period by the same number of years at the RDR to get the PV of the true buffer

High Level Answer
Adjusted buffer is the surplus in the par fund. However, shareholders can technically only access this surplus after all the business has run off
 
So we project the surplus for another 120 years (assuming that the business run off) then discount back at the RDR to get the PV of the surplus at the current period, which is the estate

PAR FUND PVFP IS THE SAME CONCEPT

PVFP = Shareholder Transfer + Residual Profits
Shareholder transfer = 10% of Cost of bonus (after tax)

Residual Future Profits
If profits emerge in the future, the shareholders cannot access them immediately (Same concept as estate)
They are added to the future buffer position
So it is the same concept -> As they emerge they are projected till run off and discounted back

High interest rates > Hits premium financing quite badly because the cost of borrowing is quite high
Cannot earn, fall in SP Par sales

Par assets is stable long term, got return but cannot beat equity etc

Surrender Value is roughly equal to the reserve of the policy
Maximum you can give without making a loss

Par products are priced conservatively, expect to make a profit
Emerging surplus
This is because MUST have profit in the par fund, people expect a bonus

Bonus is sensitive because
* PRE -> U told them X, give Y, need to explain
* Comparison -> Other insurer operate in the same environment, how to make sure u are being reasonable?

Income only gives SV for par
Actuarial principle is that it is the PV of other benefits, net of expense
Idea is to refund the benefits that would have been paid to the policyholder, u shld receive this amount


In practice, SV rates are rather competitive because ppl tend to compare from illustration
Take other peoples SV factor then tweak it to look better
Look at key years because ppl generally look at key timepoints (EG. Y10, Y20) tweak ours to look slightly better at year 20

Need to be actuarially sound as well > Compare the adjusted rates to the asset share, should be close to 100%
Cannot give more than 100% because cannot give them more than what the policy owns
Cannot give less because not fair

Generally speaking, cannot give wholesale because different mortality assumption etc, not suitable
Not so sciency

# Paid Up Policies

Option to policyholders to stop paying their premium by reducing their coverage to an amount proportional to the amount already paid

Functionally equivalent to surrendering your current policy for its SV
Using the value to buy a non-par policy for the remaining term with a reduced SA

If the original policy is Par, the new PUP will not receive any future bonuses as they are non-par
The TB rate used the rate as at the date of becoming paid up, since "surrender" the policy at that date will trigger that TB rate

A few points:
1. Although it is functionally equivalent to surrendering the policy, the formula used by income does not apply the SV factor on the surrendered RB/SB
2. TB at the point of paid up is not treated as declaring the TB at that date, thus loss of a possible shareholder transfer at that point

Paid up PSI cannot be more informative than normal PSI, because dont want the policyholder to become paid up
Mid Term Add also need illustration

The nature of recognizing the buffer allocated to shareholders must allow for two main considerations: Regulatory restrictions on profits distribution for the Participating Fund: Under Singapore Risk Based Capital (“RBC”) framework, profits from the Participating fund can only be distributed to shareholders through shareholder transfers. Consequently, the buffer allocated to shareholders as at the valuation date cannot be recognized in its entirety as it cannot be directly extracted as profits.
