# **Universal Life Insurance**

## **Overview**

Universal Life Insurance is a plan where premiums are paid into a **notional account** that earns interest. The cost of insurance coverage (and other necessary expenses) are **deducted from the account** every period. The account value is also the **cash value** of the policy which can be **fully or PARTIALLY withdrawn** after an initial period. The policy lapses when the **account value is depleted**.

!!! Note

    It is possible that the interest earned on the account value exceeds the amount of charges, resulting in  a “self-sustaining” policy.

The interest earned on the account is known as the **Crediting Rate**, which typically has a **minimum floor** to ensure the account grows, but consequently also has a **maximum ceiling** on the returns. The insurer **earns the spread** of the crediting rate and their actual return on their investments.

Universal Life is known for its **flexibility** as the policyholder can choose **how much premium** to pay each period as well as **adjust their benefit** post-inception (subject to underwriting).

Given the above, the policyholder can effectively solve for the amount of premiums needed so that the resulting UL plan (assuming actual returns follow expected) **mimics another kind of policy** (Term, Endowment or WL).

!!! Tip

    It is useful to think of UL as a YRT with an account value, where the cost of the YRT is deducted from the fund.


### **Sum at Risk**

There are typically **two kinds** of Universal Life plans:

<center>

|      **Option A**      |       **Option B**       |
| :--------------------: | :----------------------: |
|  Level death benefit   | Increasing death benefit |
| Decreasing sum at risk |   Constant sum at risk   |

</center>

The policy will pay out either the death benefit or the account value. Thus, the cash value can be used to **fund the death benefit**. The shortfall is known as the **Sum at Risk** (SAR), which is the actual amount of coverage the insurer provides, which is the **basis for the COI** charge.

**Option A** universal life is a plan where the sum at risk changes based on the account value. In an ideal scenario where the account value is growing, option A results in a **decreasing SAR** over time. If the SAR reaches 0, then there is essentially NO insurance coverage provided, thus the policy is **no longer considered an insurance contract** and hence does not enjoy the typical statutory benefits.

Thus, to avoid the above scenario, the death benefit will be **automatically increased** once the account value catches up to it. The amount that the death benefit is increased is known as the **Corridoor**. It is defined as a **proportion** of the account value, typically the minimum amount of SAR that is needed to be considered an insurance contract.

**Option B** universal life is much simpler, where the death benefit is a combination of the account value and the sum assured. The death benefit scales proportionally with the account value, resulting in a **constant SAR**.

### **Target Premium**

Since there are no premium requirements, policyholders have a high chance of under-paying the policy, causing it to **lapse earlier** than expected.

Thus, the insurer usually recommends a premium amount that *SHOULD* keep the policy in-force for a specified number of years. There is **no guarantee** that the policy will, because of the uncertainty in the crediting rate.

!!! Warning

    UL is often marketed as a “whole life” product. However, this is misleading because there is no guarantee that the policy will remain in-force for that duration.
    
    This is contrary to other products where payment of the premium guarantees the coverage. Consumers who pay the target premium consistently might see their policy lapse and “cheated” by the insurance company as a result.

### **Surrender Charge**

### **No Lapse Guarantee**


### **Premium Financing**

Use your own (non cash) assets as collateral for a bank loan for the premiums, allows you to purchase insurance while still staying invested in your business etc

Bank owns the policy? The cash value of the policy can be used as collateral as well, the difference between that and the loan amount is the collateral needed

## **Indexed Universal Life**

Indexed Universal Life (IUL) is a variant of UL whose crediting rate follows that of a specified underlying index (EG. S&P500). The extent to which the crediting rate follows the index is known as the **participation rate**.

The account of any UL policy is purely **notional**. The insurer does not actually purchase the underlying index to support the policy.


IUL is the most common variation as the risk is much lower compared to VUL
UL is a high net worth focused product. Mainly comes in the form of SP policy

Supported heavily by premium financing - bank interest is 2%, UL credited rate is more than 2.0%

Policyholder essentially earn the spread

High net worth means branding is very important. Rich ppl want good service, good brand name, want to be able to tell ppl that they dropped X in this company etc.

Distribution must be able to reach these ppl to sell



How does it make sense that interest rate is 2 but credit 2.5?

If assets all in the same place, doesn’t make sense, high risk. If have global investment team, earned rate is higher than the borrowing cost

Also cos investment could be in non debt assets, earning higher rate than credited

WL coi which is fixed

Investment grow more than COI, free insurance essentially

Premium financing borrow from bank buy par product
Bundled product means can only buy if u but others


From a projection perspective, for P/L Purposes, the Unit fund should have no surplus since it’s owned by the policyholder

Surrender Charge is also a deterrence against bank run

Need the funds to cover the future shortfall


Potentially higher costs - VUL policies may be more expensive than other types of permanent insurance, such as Whole Life and traditional Universal Life. Volatility of cash surrender values, especially at late duration, can cause a "reverse dollar cost averaging" effect that results in higher costs of insurance charges. Proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk, but it cannot be completely eliminated.

lock your money up in all kinds of strange ways and do not compensate you for the illiquidity.


This makes a VL policy *potentially more attractive* than every other kind of policy. However, this is only true if the return on investments outpace both inflation and the investment return of the insurer. Although equity does earn substantially higher returns over a *long* period of time, **short term deviations** are inevitable and the policy value could drop substantially if the investments go bad.



* **Variable UL**: Based on the performance of a specific mutual fund

HNW 1m
UHMW 30m
Self made professionals, entrepeneur or inherited
Business succession is the most important and longevity
High degree of personalization and established relationship
Typically single premium UL
White glove status > elite, solitaire 
Typically non taxable
Most important is the source of funds > Wher they get the money, is it money laundering or tax evasion
Single point of contact, active case management, tailored approach with value added services, confidentiality, coutesy calls, flexible access to advanced healthcare etc


Younger HMW > Aggressive wealth growth 
Older HWN > Conservarive wealth preservation 

Case size larger, underwriting more comprehensive
