# **Universal Life Insurance**

## **Overview**

Universal Life Insurance is a plan where premiums are paid into a **notional account** that earns interest. The cost of insurance coverage (and other necessary expenses) are **deducted from the account** every period. The account value is also the **cash value** of the policy which can be **fully or PARTIALLY withdrawn** after an initial period. The policy lapses when the **account value is depleted**.

The interest earned on the account is known as the **Crediting Rate**, which typically has a **minimum floor** to ensure the account grows, but consequently also has a **maximum ceiling** on the returns. The insurer **earns the spread** of the crediting rate and their actual return on their investments.

* **Traditional UL**: Based on the performance of the insurer's investments
* **Indexed UL**: Based on the performance of a specified index
* **Variable UL**: Based on the performance of a specific mutual fund

!!! Note

    In the case of IUL and VUL, there is also a **Participation Rate** which defines how closely the crediting rate tracks the specified portfolios.

!!! Warning

    The account is purely **notional** - the index or mutual fund is not actually purchased under the policy.

Universal Life is known for its **flexibility** as the policyholder can choose **how much premium** to pay each period as well as **adjust their benefit** post-inception (subject to underwriting).

Given the above, the policyholder can effectively solve for the amount of premiums needed so that the resulting UL plan (assuming actual returns follow expected) mimics another kind of policy (Term, Endowment or WL).

!!! Tip

    It is useful to think of UL as a YRT with an account value, where the cost of the YRT is deducted from the fund.

### **Sum at Risk**

There are typically **two kinds** of Universal Life plans:

<center>

|      **Option A**      |       **Option B**       |
| :--------------------: | :----------------------: |
|  Level death benefit   | Increasing death benefit |
| Decreasing sum at risk |   Constant sum at risk   |

</center>

The policy will pay out either the death benefit or the account value. Thus, the cash value can be used to **fund the death benefit**. The shortfall is known as the **Sum at Risk** (SAR), which is the amount of coverage the insurer provides, which is the basis for the COI charge.

**Option A** universal life is a plan where the sum at risk changes based on the account value. In an ideal scenario where the account value is growing, option A results in a **decreasing SAR** over time. If the SAR reaches 0, then there is essentially NO insurance coverage provided, thus the policy is **no longer considered an insurance contract** and hence does not enjoy the typical statutory benefits.

Thus, to avoid the above scenario, the death benefit will be **automatically increased** once the account value catches up to it. The amount that the death benefit is increased is known as the **Corridoor**. It is defined as a **proportion** of the account value, typically the minimum amount of SAR that is needed to be considered an insurance contract.

**Option B** universal life is much simpler, where the death benefit is a combination of the account value and the sum assured. The death benefit scales proportionally with the account value, resulting in a **constant SAR**.

### **Target Premium**

Since there are no premium requirements, policyholders have a high chance of under-paying the policy, causing it to **lapse earlier** than expected.

Thus, the insurer usually recommends a premium amount that *SHOULD* keep the policy in-force for a specified number of years. There is **no guarantee** that the policy will, because of the uncertainty in the crediting rate.

!!! Warning

    UL is often marketed as a “whole life” product. However, this is misleading because there is no guarantee that the policy will remain in-force for that duration.
    
    This is contrary to other products where payment of the premium guarantees the coverage. Consumers who pay the target premium consistently might see their policy lapse and “cheated” by the insurance company as a result.
