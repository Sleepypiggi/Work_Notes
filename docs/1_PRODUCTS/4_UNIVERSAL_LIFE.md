# **Universal Life Insurance**

## **Overview**

Universal Life Insurance is a plan where premiums are paid into a **notional account** that earns interest. The cost of insurance coverage (and other necessary expenses) are **deducted from the account** every period. The account value is also the **cash value** of the policy which can be **fully or PARTIALLY withdrawn** after an initial period. The policy lapses when the **account value is depleted**.

The interest earned on the account is known as the **Crediting Rate**, which typically has a **minimum floor** to ensure the account grows, but consequently also has a **maximum ceiling** on the returns. The insurer **earns the spread** of the crediting rate and their actual return on their investments.

* **Traditional UL**: Based on the performance of the insurer's investments
* **Indexed UL**: Based on the performance of a specified index
* **Variable UL**: Based on the performance of a specific mutual fund

!!! Note

    In the case of IUL and VUL, there is also a **Participation Rate** which defines how closely the crediting rate tracks the specified portfolios.

!!! Warning

    The account is purely **notional** - the index or mutual fund is not actually purchased under the policy.

Universal Life is known for its **flexibility** as the policyholder can choose **how much premium** to pay each period as well as **adjust their benefit** post-inception (subject to underwriting).

!!! Tip

    It is useful to think of UL as a YRT with an account value, where the cost of the YRT is deducted from the fund.

### **Sum at Risk**

There are typically **two kinds** of Universal Life plans:

<center>

|      **Option A**      |       **Option B**       |
| :--------------------: | :----------------------: |
|  Level death benefit   | Increasing death benefit |
| Decreasing sum at risk |   Constant sum at risk   |

</center>

The policy will pay out either the death benefit or the account value. Thus, the cash value can be used to **fund the death benefit**. The shortfall is known as the **Sum at Risk** (SAR), which is the amount of coverage the insurer provides, which is the basis for the COI charge.

**Option A** universal life is a plan where the sum at risk changes based on the account value. In an ideal scenario where the account value is growing, option A results in a **decreasing SAR** over time. If the SAR reaches 0, then there is essentially NO insurance coverage provided, thus the policy is **no longer considered an insurance contract** and hence does not enjoy the typical statutory benefits.

Thus, to avoid the above scenario, the death benefit will be **automatically increased** once the account value catches up to it. The amount that the death benefit is increased is known as the **Corridoor**. It is defined as a **proportion** of the account value, typically the minimum amount of SAR that is needed to be considered an insurance contract.

**Option B** universal life is much simpler, where the death benefit is a combination of the account value and the sum assured. The death benefit scales proportionally with the account value, resulting in a **constant SAR**.

### **Target Premium**

Since there are no premium requirements, policyholders have a high chance of under-paying the policy, causing it to lapse earlier than expected.



However, because there are no premium requirements, insureds are **more likely to lapse** their policies as they may end up paying too little or not at all. Insurers attempt to minimize this by providing a **target premium** that the insured should aim to pay each period to keep the policy adequately funded.

> This target premium is also often the *maximum* premium that agents can earn the standard commission rate. Premiums paid in **excess of the target** earn lesser commissions. This incentivises agents to recommend the insured to pay *at least* the target premium. However, this method has **limited effectiveness** as the decision ultimately sits with the insured.
