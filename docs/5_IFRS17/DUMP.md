At initial recognition of an insurance contract, you will habe three main components of the initial liability, as stated, the BEL, RA, and CSM. Each of these components will change in subsequent measurements (typically annually). A portion of the RA will he released into profits, as well as a portion of the CSM. A portion of BEL may also flow into profits, depending on the actual claims, expenses, and premiums recognized during that period.

Insurance Revenue under IFRS 17 is defined by: Expected claims + Expected expenses - actual claims - actual expenses + CSM release + RA release.

The expected minus actual bit there simply defines deviation grom expectations, which flows directly into P/L.

RA release can be defines differently from company to company, but it is typically an amount proportional to the amount of service provided in the period, which could be based off expected or actual claims. For example, if at initial recognition your PV(claims) = $100k and you have an RA of $10k, if you expected $5k of claims to be incurred over the past year, then your RA release would be $0.5k.

The CSM release is based on an amortization schedule that is defined at initial onset, and also uses locked in discount rates at initial recognition. Your initial CSM, which is essentially a liability for future profits, and is defined as total profits at time 0, which is ( -[PV(outflows)-PV(inflows)] - RA), is going to be released according to the amortization schedule, which should be defined by the expected amount of service to be provided im a period, which is similar to the RA release. One thing to note here though, is that BEFORE the CSM is released according to the amortization schedule, it is adjusted for several items, like recognition of new contracts in a group, or changes in discount rates. Then the initial percentage defined by the amortization schedule is to be applied to the CSM balance, and released directly into P/L for the period.

Hope this helps! And anyone, please correct me if any of this information isn't 100% accurate.

Coverage units significantly impact the calculation and allocation of the Contractual Service Margin (CSM) in insurance contracts under IFRS 17. Here’s how:

Contractual Service Margin (CSM)

The CSM is the unearned profit that an insurer expects to earn from insurance contracts over the coverage period. It ensures that no profit is recognized at the initial recognition of the contract.

Coverage Units

Coverage units represent the amount of insurance coverage provided during each period. They reflect the expected pattern of release of the CSM over the coverage period. The concept ensures that the CSM is released in a way that aligns with the insurance service provided.

Impact on CSM

 1. Initial Measurement:
 • At initial recognition, the CSM is calculated as the difference between the premiums received (or expected) and the fulfillment cash flows (present value of future cash flows, including claims and expenses).
 2. Subsequent Allocation:
 • The CSM is systematically recognized in profit or loss over the coverage period using the coverage units.
 • Coverage units determine the allocation pattern, ensuring the CSM release corresponds to the insurance service provided.
 • This allocation is done by dividing the CSM by the total number of coverage units over the contract’s duration, then recognizing the portion corresponding to the coverage units for the period.

Example

Assume an insurance contract provides coverage of $1 million in year one, $1.5 million in year two, and $500,000 in year three. The total coverage over the three years is $3 million.

 1. Coverage Units:
 • Year 1: 1/3 of the total coverage units.
 • Year 2: 1.5/3 of the total coverage units.
 • Year 3: 0.5/3 of the total coverage units.
 2. CSM Allocation:
 • If the initial CSM is $900,000, the allocation per year based on coverage units would be:
 • Year 1:  900,000 \times \frac{1}{3} = 300,000 
 • Year 2:  900,000 \times \frac{1.5}{3} = 450,000 
 • Year 3:  900,000 \times \frac{0.5}{3} = 150,000 

Thus, the CSM is recognized in profit or loss in a manner consistent with the insurance services provided.

Summary

Coverage units are crucial for the appropriate recognition of the CSM, ensuring it aligns with the service provided over the life of the contract. This systematic allocation helps in reflecting the insurer’s performance and profitability accurately over time.

IFRS9 - Asset treatment
IFRS17 - Insurance Liability treatment

Which is why the first thing 17 does is to distinguish between asset and liability

Another problem of current insurance accounting is the “volatility” in profits

Profits early and losses later

IFRS17 smooths this by withholding the profit into a B/S item called CSM which sometimes the profit throughout the lifetime of the policy, removing this volatility

Conversely if a contract is loss making from the get go, losses are recognized upfront into an item called Loss Component

If a contract flips, there will be some reversal on both sides

CSM is very different from EV due to different assumptions

But mainly due to Teo large components
1\ Cost of Reserve
2\ Cost of Capital

Reserve and Capital earn ABL and ABC respectively, but shareholder want RDR, losing the difference

IFRS4 is transparent because almost everything is on a cash basis, only reserve line is not

IFRS17 is opaque because of CSM

CSM has a crucial concept relating to current or future service

Current - Recognize now
Future - Capitalize and amortize

EG. Acquisition cost - Pay now, but actually relating to future service

Mgmt expenses - Pay now, relating to current maintenance

CSM = Neg Res less RA
RA is like PAD, but at a lower level because cannot be too conservative from an accounting perspective

Expense got no materiality, it is accounting

Accounting cannot lose any cent


IFRS4 > Use local standards > Different results for different groups
IFRS17 > Standardized

High level idea
Calculate the profits expected
Spread profit over duration

Inflow - outflow + TVM (Interest) - Risk Adjustment (Uncertainty) = PV Profits = Contractual Service Margin

Spread across BBA > General Measurement Model, Variable Fee Approach, Premium Allocation Approach (Short term)

International Financial Reporting Standard 17 (IFRS17)
Overview
	As mentioned earlier, Insurers follow a special set of accounting guidelines
	The previous set of guidelines were released in 2004 (IFRS4) and the latest set was released in 2017 (IFRS17)
	IFRS17 will officially take effect from the start of 2023, which is why IFRS17 has been a hot topic for insurers the past few years as everyone is preparing for it
	The change in reporting standard is meant to bring even greater transparency to allow a greater understanding of the performance of the company

Litmus Test
	IFRS17 should be used to report on contracts that pose significant insurance risk
	There is a precise definition of what constitutes an insurance risk (Not covered here). To determine if it is significant, we can use one of the following metrics:
	PV (Ouflows)>PV (Inflows)
	(PV (Outflows ┤|  Insured event occurs))/PV(Outlowd | Insured event does NOT occur) >103~105%
	Note that the PV uses the per policy cashflows, NOT the expected ones
	If the contract does not qualify as a significant insurance risk, then the contract should be accounted for using another financial reporting standard:
	IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
	IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts

	Life Insurance	General Insurance
Event occurs	Death; Death Benefit	Max(Loss,Limit)

Event does not occur	Survival; Surrender Benefit	0
	Since there are no cashflows under the scenario where the insured event does not occur, General Insurance products typically always pose a significant insurance risk hence no quantitative test is needed

Measurement Models
	General Measurement Model (GMM) → Non-participating Life Contracts
	Variable Fee Approach (VFA) → Participating Life Contracts
	Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) → Short-term Contracts

Contractual Service Margin (CSM)
- Unearned profit the insurer will recognise as it provides insurance contract services in the future
IFRS17 introduced contractual service margins 
Stored value and release abit of it every year to the P/L in accordance to the service provided that year sort of like amortization 
Any change that affects the future value would affect the CSM while changes that affect the present would affect the current P/L directly 

What we have collected is already 
How much Assets that are we related to this business, not just policies, intangible business 
Potential to sell (Future premiums)

Contractual Service margin > Component of the measurement of the insurance contract representing the unearned profit that the entity recognises AS it provides the insurance contract services

CSM = PV expectred future inflows – PV expected future outflows


Financial world is all about how you categorize Assets and Liabilities

Insurance Metrics 
Annual Premium Equivalent 
	• Measure of the new business acquired over a period o 100% of Regular Premium + 10% Single Premium 
	
	• Companies internally monitor the growth of APE over time. These changes are driven by not only Volume but by the Mix of products as well (RP vs SP) 

Embedded Value 
	• Estimate of the Economic Value of a Life Insurer based on existing busines. It reflects the objective long-term profit or prospects of the insurer o 𝐸𝑉=𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡 𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑡ℎ+𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒 𝐵𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 (𝑃𝑉𝐼𝐹) 
	
	• Thus, there two kinds of Embedded Values: o Traditional Embedded Value (TEV) → Asian (Focus) 
	o Market Consistent Embedded Value (MCEV) → European 
	

Value of New Business 
	• Regulators are concerned with the Reserves which we have determined above. However, they give no indication about the value of the company, which is what Investors are interested in o Currently reserves account for Cash Inflows and Outflows, but fail to account for investments in the company which makes it inaccurate
