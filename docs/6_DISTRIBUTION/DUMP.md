Churning
Agent FY Commission is always higher, incentive to get customer to lapse and buy new policies
Churning must always have a conflict of interest - get customer to lapse against their best interest


Churning and break even period very careful. 
If have 5 pay 5 break even capital, will have high churning
Need to delink the two to derisk

To convince agent to move, you need to convince them to give up their existing pool of renewal commissions

Buying agents is a long term investment because they take some times to re-establish their base

Key is usually to recruit the leader and they will bring their minions

Recruiting agents this way has a net loss on the industry

The agents are all musical chairs, a few years move around

Then companies pay them a large amount of money to move 

Incur cost for the same thing every few years, leading to increased costs

MAS some regulation on buying agents

How to measure incremental sales from promotion?

Can’t ask agents, they will obviously say that they want, more promo is good

Good promo should drive a certain mix of policyholders that are more profitable

QPB is a multiplier of the AFYC

Sell the policy
Pass to fresh grad agent
Then convince the client to lapse and buy

Fresh grad become scapegoat
Can’t track churning so easily

Hard to manage cos want to have the sales, can’t stop the agent
churning is bad for company, keep incurring selling expenses and fixed expenses


RFS foundational problem - once u establish clientele, why would u not go commission based

Client had budget, cannot sell too many things at once

DPS Mindef loss making, key benefit is the cross selling

Promo could be run for two reasons

Top line or bottom line

Bottom line promo should be run using specific mechanics - what kind of mix of policyholder will give you the most NBEV?

Is it reasonable to run a promo to drive that mix?

Can your system support it?


Recapture business
run promo make sure cannot game thw system
