## **Mortality**

Select Mortality
For newly insured levels
Must be lower than the average person because they must have been in good health to qualify initially
Usually lasts for a short period (5 years) before moving on

Ultimate Mortality

Benefit of selection has faded
Higher than select

Aggrgeate Mortality

	For traditional policies, Lapse Rates tend to be highest in the first year of the policy as some people tend to regret their purchase

	After the Surrender Charge Period, Lapse Rates tend to increase again as people who were waiting for the first chance to leave without penalty
