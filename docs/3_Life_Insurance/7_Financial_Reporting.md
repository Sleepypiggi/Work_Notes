International Financial Reporting Standard 17 (IFRS17)
Overview
	As mentioned earlier, Insurers follow a special set of accounting guidelines
	The previous set of guidelines were released in 2004 (IFRS4) and the latest set was released in 2017 (IFRS17)
	IFRS17 will officially take effect from the start of 2023, which is why IFRS17 has been a hot topic for insurers the past few years as everyone is preparing for it
	The change in reporting standard is meant to bring even greater transparency to allow a greater understanding of the performance of the company

Litmus Test
	IFRS17 should be used to report on contracts that pose significant insurance risk
	There is a precise definition of what constitutes an insurance risk (Not covered here). To determine if it is significant, we can use one of the following metrics:
	PV (Ouflows)>PV (Inflows)
	(PV (Outflows ┤|  Insured event occurs))/PV(Outlowd | Insured event does NOT occur) >103~105%
	Note that the PV uses the per policy cashflows, NOT the expected ones
	If the contract does not qualify as a significant insurance risk, then the contract should be accounted for using another financial reporting standard:
	IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
	IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts

	Life Insurance	General Insurance
Event occurs	Death; Death Benefit	Max(Loss,Limit)

Event does not occur	Survival; Surrender Benefit	0
	Since there are no cashflows under the scenario where the insured event does not occur, General Insurance products typically always pose a significant insurance risk hence no quantitative test is needed

Measurement Models
	General Measurement Model (GMM) → Non-participating Life Contracts
	Variable Fee Approach (VFA) → Participating Life Contracts
	Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) → Short-term Contracts

Contractual Service Margin (CSM)
- Unearned profit the insurer will recognise as it provides insurance contract services in the future
IFRS17 introduced contractual service margins 
Stored value and release abit of it every year to the P/L in accordance to the service provided that year sort of like amortization 
Any change that affects the future value would affect the CSM while changes that affect the present would affect the current P/L directly 

What we have collected is already 
How much Assets that are we related to this business, not just policies, intangible business 
Potential to sell (Future premiums)

Contractual Service margin > Component of the measurement of the insurance contract representing the unearned profit that the entity recognises AS it provides the insurance contract services

CSM = PV expectred future inflows – PV expected future outflows


Financial world is all about how you categorize Assets and Liabilities

Insurance Metrics 
Annual Premium Equivalent 
	• Measure of the new business acquired over a period o 100% of Regular Premium + 10% Single Premium 
	
	• Companies internally monitor the growth of APE over time. These changes are driven by not only Volume but by the Mix of products as well (RP vs SP) 

Embedded Value 
	• Estimate of the Economic Value of a Life Insurer based on existing busines. It reflects the objective long-term profit or prospects of the insurer o 𝐸𝑉=𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡 𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑡ℎ+𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒 𝐵𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 (𝑃𝑉𝐼𝐹) 
	
	• Thus, there two kinds of Embedded Values: o Traditional Embedded Value (TEV) → Asian (Focus) 
	o Market Consistent Embedded Value (MCEV) → European 
	

Value of New Business 
	• Regulators are concerned with the Reserves which we have determined above. However, they give no indication about the value of the company, which is what Investors are interested in o Currently reserves account for Cash Inflows and Outflows, but fail to account for investments in the company which makes it inaccurate
