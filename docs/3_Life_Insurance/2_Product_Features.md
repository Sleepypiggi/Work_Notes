# **Product Features**

This section is meant to dive deeper into commonly found product features within each major product category.

## **Term**

### **Renewability**

Most term policies with short coverage periods (1 - 10 years) are **renewable**, allowing the policyholder to renew the policy and **extend coverage** for specified number of years, usually equal to the original coverage period. The policy can be **renewed any number of times** up till the insured reaches an age limit specified by the insured.

This feature is to allow policyholders to extend their coverage without needing to purchase a new policy. This is beneficial because health tends to worsen with age, thus the insureds health may have **significantly deteriorated** from the initial purcahse, up to the point where no insurer would want to provide coverage. Thus, this feature allows policyholders to *skip the medical underwriting process*, **guaranteeing** them an extension.

The renewed policy will always have a **higher premium** than the original, to reflect the increased mortality risk with age.

Renewable products also suffer from **Adverse Selection**. Insureds in good health would rather go through medical underwriting under a different insurer to obtain lower premiums. This means that only insureds in *poor health* would renew their term policies, which forces insurers to charge higher premiums as well.

To overcome this, some insurers offer a **Re-entry** option to allow policyholders to go through medical underwriting upon renewal to obtain lower premiums. This encourages insureds in good health to volunteer more information about their risk, allowing the insurer to use a more refined risk classification which usually results in lower premiums. Insureds in good health are more likely to renew their policies with the insurer rather than search for a new one, reducing the adverse selection.

It is known as Re-entry because the insured *re-enters* the **Select Mortality Group** upon renewal. More information about the different types of Mortality can be found in a later section on Experience Factors.

### **Convertibility**

Another commonly offered feature is the **option to convert** the term policy into a Permanent policy. The option to convert is only valid for a **specified period**, usually *much shorter* than the policy period.

It is usually meant for insureds who wanted to purchase a permanent policy but **could not afford** to do so at the time or for insureds who suspect that their **circumstances might change** in a way that may require a permanent policy instead.

|        Attained Age Conversion         |            Original Age Conversion             |
| :------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: |
|         Prospective conversion         |             Retroactive conversion             |
| Premiums based on age as at conversion |    Premiums based on age as at original age    |
|  Premium rates as at conversion date   |       Premium rates as at original date        |
|     No additional payment required     | Difference in premiums & interest must be paid |

Insureds might prefer the Original Age conversion as they would get a lower premium and more liberal coverage due to the lower age. However, premium rates have been decreasing over the years, which may make an Attained Age conversion more attractive. Even if the rates were not better, the insured might not have the capital to pay back the premiums and interest, which makes the attained method more attractive.

As with Renewability, the main purpose of this feature is to **guarantee** a conversion to a permanent policy, rather than having to purchase a new permanent policy. For healthy insureds, this option is worthless as they would be indifferent to converting or purchasing a new one - thus, there are usually some **premium incentives** to encourage conversion.

Convertible policies provides an **embedded option** within the policy, which makes it more flexible but have higher premiums as a result.

### **Non-Level Benefits**

The term insurance we have discussed thus assume a **level death benefit** - it remains constant throughout the policy lifetime. However, there are also **non-level death benefits** that can change over the course of the policy.

**Decreasing benefits** is the most common form of non-level term insurance. It is usually used in a context where the **financial obligation decreases** as long as the insured is alive.

For instance, mortgages or other kinds of **debt** are repaid every month for a fixed duration with the **outstanding balance decreasing over time**. If the insured passes on, then their dependents would be required to pay off the debt. They can insure against this risk using term insurance:

* The policy period should be equal to the debt repayment period
* The starting coverage should be equal to the debt principal/outstanding balance to account for the policy passing on immediately
* Each period the insured remains alive, they reduce the outstanding balance thus reducing the necessary coverage - the coverage should fall by an equal amount each period as well
* This ensures that if the insured dies at any point before the debt is paid off, their dependents will have sufficient capital to pay it off

![Decreasing Term](Assets/1.%20Life%20Products.md/Decreasing%20Term.png)

**Increasing benefits** is much less common. It works by automatically **PURCHASING additional units** of term coverage each period, without the need to go through medical underwriting (guaranteed).

Increasing Term is rarely sold as a standalone policy but rather as a Rider for an existing policy, most commonly (but still rare) as a **Cost of Living Adjustment**. The addittional coverage purchased is tied to the inflation rate that period - increasing if inflation goes up but staying level if inflation goes down.

Since the additional coverage is bought incrementally over time, the **cost of the addittional coverage increases** (relative to the previous periods) due to the increasing age of the insured (Similar to a yearly renewal). Depending on how long it increases, the insured may have been better off purchasing a policy with a higher level right from the beginning.

### **Return of Premium**

Term policies are often viewed as a **sunk cost** as the premiums paid are worthless if the insured outlives the policy period. Thus, some policies offer a **cash value equal to the sum of the premiums paid** up till that time, hence "returning" the premium paid to the insured.

Unlike a permanent policy, the cash value is **only available after a specified duration or up till a certain age**, usually the end of the policy period. Some ROP policies are also convertible, where the cash value can be transferred into a new permanent policy and continue to accumulate.

Naturally, the premiums are higher than a regular term policy as there needs to be additional capital used to build up the cash value on top of the regular insurance coverage. More information on cash values will be covered in the permanent insurance subsection.

## **Whole Life**

### **Nonforfeiture Options**

All permanent insurance contracts have a **non-forfeiture** clause which states that the **insured will not forfeit the value** of the policy when the policy is terminated (unlike in Term), which is why they build up cash values to provide an alternative form of value in the policy. Although it is called *Cash* Value, receiving the amount in cash is *not the only way* the value can be passed on to the policyholder.

Another option is that the amount is used as a **Single Premium** to purchase a **Paid Up** *permanent* insurance, usually with **reduced coverage** than the original. This *converts* the policy into a paid up one with reduced coverage, known as **Reduced Paid Up (RPU) Insurance**.

Similarly, the amount can be used as a Single premium to purchase a paid up *Term* Insurance with the **same coverage** with a policy period for **as long as** the cash value can purchase. This extends the coverage of the insured via a term policy, which is why it is known as **Extended Term Insurance**.

If the policyholder lapses the policy, one of the three options will be applied automatically, depending on what the insured specifies beforehand.

### **Loans and Withdrawals**

Another way to access the cash value of the policy is through a **Partial Withdrawal** or **Loan**.

The insured can withdraw a *portion* of their cash value, much like withdrawing funds from a bank account. However, any withdrawal will **also lower death benefit** by the same amount. This is to *prevent* the insured from receiving more than the coverage of the policy.

For instance, assume that the death benefit was 100 and 50 was withdrawn. When the insured dies, they will receive 100 on top of the 50 they already took out, more than the coverage of the policy by the withdrawal amount.

The insurer may also **limit the withdrawals** per year and/or charge an **additional withdrawal fee** (on top of the surrender charge, if any).

> Note that it is called a *Partial* withdrawal because a "Full" withdrawal of the cash value is equivalent to a surrendering the policy. In the same light, it can also be referred to as a *Partial Surrender* of the policy.

Alternatively, the insured can take a Loan from the policy, much like taking a loan from any other financial instituition. Loans can be repaid at any time but the outstanding balance each period earns interest, usually at a rate equal to the rate credited to the cash value.

Unlike a withdrawal, it does not immediately reduce the death/surrender benefit of the policy. However, the policy benefits will be used as **collateral** for the loan - if the insured does not repay the loan balance by the time the policy makes a payout, then the loan balance will be deducted from the benefits.

Note that if the outstanding balance of the loan exceeds the Cash Value of the policy, the insured has a grace Pperiod to make loan repayments, otherwise the policy will **Lapse**.

Most policies also contain an **Automatic Premium Loan (APL)** feature - whereby if the insured has not paid their premiums by the end of the grace period, the policy will automatically take a loan against the cash value of the policy to pay the premium and keep the policy in force.

<!--
Cash value = Reserve?
Guaranteed vs Non Guaranteed Cash values

Front End Load > Cash value build up after specified period
Bakc end load > Cash value after awhile

For investments in the General Account, the insurer earns the difference in investment returns between the amount credited to the cash value and the actual returns

Understanding Cash Value
	The purpose of Cash Value is to reduce the amount of money that the insurer has to pay when you die. You can only get either the Surrender Value or the Death Benefit. If you die, your beneficiaries only get the Death Benefit while the Surrender Value goes to the insurer, which is used to offset the cost of the death benefit to the insurer
	At the beginning of the policy, the Cash Value is low, which means that the risk to the insurer is high. Thus, the premiums mostly go towards paying for the insurance (Mortality charge)
	
Cash Value & New Business Strain
	A more proper way to think about Cash Value is that it is the Net Premium Reserve
	Reserves cover future claims – Death OR Surrender Benefit (Cash Value)
	As alluded to earlier, in the early years of a policy, the premium collected is insufficient to cover Expenses, Insurance Charges and the Regulatory Reserve required
	Insurers thus have to fork out their own capital to fulfil the reserve requirement, immediately taking a loss, known as the New Business Strain
	NBS=Initial Cash Outlow-Cash Inflow
	If the insurer does not have enough capital, writing too much new business can significantly impact their financial standing
	But writing more business also improves long term financial standing
	As more premiums are collected, the reserve will slowly build up and the insurer will recoup their loss & building up Cash Value as well
	Since the reserves are meant to cover future claims, the maximum amount in the reserve is the Death Benefit. Since the Reserve is the Cash Value as well, the Cash Value will never exceed the Death Benefit

Typically lower than total premiums paid

## **Participating**

### **Guaranteed & Non-Guaranteed Elements**

**Non-Guaranteed Elements (NGE)** are benefits or charges in the policy that are not fixed and can thus be changed at the **discretion of the insurer**, depending on *expectations about future experience*. For instance, the credited interest rate and expenses are typically non-guaranteed elements as they depend on market conditions at the time.

However, insurers also provide **Guaranteed Elements** in the policy to limit the variance of the NGE. This comes in the form of guaranteed **minimum benefits** or **maximum charges** for the non-guaranteed elements. The insurer has the discretion to change the NGE within the bounds of their guarantees.

These non-guaranteed elements allows the insured to **share the experience** of the insurer, which may allow them to be better off compared to an otherwise all guaranteed policy.

### Policyholder Reasonable Expectation

Projecting the maximum illustrated assumed interest rates (generally, 12%), using current (or assumed) administrative expenses and current costs of insurance, without showing the prospective client several other assumed rates of return, creating a Blue Sky problem.

The divisible surplus will then be **split among all par policies** in an equitable way, depending on how much they contributed to the surplus. The mechanics of this split will be covered in the section on In Force Management.

Naturally, dividends are a **NGE** as they are dependent on the *past experience* of the insurer. Despite being non-guaranteed, insureds often feel cheated if what they receive is **significantly different** from what was advertised on the policy illustration. While the insurers were not at fault, this has caused reputational issues in the past thus it is in the insurers best interest to payout dividends at a rate **close to what was advertised**.

Insurers accomplish this by **smoothing** the dividends over time, avoiding large fluctuations. When the surplus is above the advertised rate, the excess may be held back to compensate for potential years where the surplus falls short.

A participating policy (**par policy**) is one that **participates profit sharing**, making them entitled to a portion of the insurers profits, known as **Dividends/Bonus**. The proportion of profits that must be distributed is known as the **Divisible Surplus**, which is dependent on regulation. In Singapore, the ratio is 9:1 - for every $9 given to insureds, the insurer is able to take $1 as profit.

<!-- Add point on why they must share the profits - it was the insureds capital? -->



The Dividend can then be passed on to the insurer in one of a few ways:

* **Cash** - Paid to the policyholder
* **Premium Reduction** - Offsets the premiums for the period/future periods
* **Accumulate at Interest** - Held with the insurer and earns compound interest; value is added to the benefit of the policy
* **Purchase Paid Up Additions (PUA)** - Used as a single premium to purchase as much paid up permanent insurance as it can, adding to the overall coverage of the policy; PUAs can be par, allowing them to **earn additional dividends**

In Singapore, most dividends **accumulate at interest** with the insurer. It usually comes in two components:

* **Reversionary Bonus (RB)** - Credited annually to the insured at a rate based on the SA of the policy. Most policies also allow it to compound; allowing previously earned bonuses to earn interest as well.
* **Terminal Bonus (TB)** - *Residual surplus* left after all reversionary bonuses have been paid. It is paid out as a **lump sum** when the policy terminates, on top of the Death/Surrender/Maturity benefit as a percentage of the SA.

The amount of any terminal
bonus payable depends on how long you have had your
policy
percentage of the accumulated reversionary bonus

Most non-par policies contain other NGEs apart from dividends, thus there is no need to purchase a par policy to share the experience of the insurer. Dividends are just an additional layer of NGEs that can be opted into.

<!--The life insurance manual defines policy dividends as refunds of premium over-payments. They are therefore not exactly like corporate stock dividends, which are payouts of net income from total revenues.

-->

## **Universal Life**

Each period, a portion of the **premiums (net of expenses) are deposited** into the cash account. As with most other saving products, the insurer also **credits interest** to the account based on some pre-defined rate, depending on the type of product.

Note that the **surrender benefit must be smaller than the death benefit**, otherwise there would be no reason for the insured to keep the policy as they would earn more by surrendering it. Thus, for policies with provisions that allow the surrender benefit of the policy to increase past the death benefit, the death benefit will increase as well - usually at some **fixed proportion of the cash value** (~101%). This addittional death benefit is known as the **Corridoor**.

In the first month, the policyholder must pay a **minimum premium** to start the policy. Thereafter, the insured is free to pay as much or as little as they like. Unlike all other policies, the policy will **only lapse if the cash value of the policy reduces to zero**.



However, because there are no premium requirements, insureds are **more likely to lapse** their policies as they may end up paying too little or not at all. Insurers attempt to minimize this by providing a **target premium** that the insured should aim to pay each period to keep the policy adequately funded.

> This target premium is also often the *maximum* premium that agents can earn the standard commission rate. Premiums paid in **excess of the target** earn lesser commissions. This incentivises agents to recommend the insured to pay *at least* the target premium. However, this method has **limited effectiveness** as the decision ultimately sits with the insured.

The death benefit of the policy usually follows one of two structures - **Option A/1** is the typical *level* death benefit policy with decreasing NAAR while **Option B/2** is an *increasing* death benefit policy with a *constant NAAR*. Thus, all else equal, an option B/2 policy will have a higher COI as more insurance is being purchased in the later years.

The insured may also **change the death benefit** of the policy at any time, further adding to the flexibility of the policy. If the change would result in an increase in future NAAR, then the increase is subject to medical underwriting.

## **Unit Linked**

This section will go over commonly found features in unit-linked products.

### **Premium Allocation**

Premium Allocation refers to what **proportion of premiums** are used to **purchase units**.

There are two commonly taken approaches, each differing in how the premium is allocated in the **first few years** of the policy:

<center>

|     **Front End Loaded**     |      **Back End Loaded**      |
| :--------------------------: | :---------------------------: |
|  Lesser than 100% allocated  |    Exactly 100% allocated     |
| No minimum investment period | Has minimum investment period |
|     No surrender charge      |     Has surrender charge      |

</center>

!!! Info

	Loading refers to the **additional amount** added to the **pure premium** to cover items such as expense, profit, tax etc.

The **cost of setting up a unit-linked policy** is generally higher than an otherwise non-unit linked policy due to all the costs associated with setting up a unit account.

As with all other policies, the insurer **recovers these costs over time**. Thus, the problem lies with policyholders who **lapse their policy before** the insurer can recover the full cost. This is more pronounced for unit linked policies given the investment nature of the product.

In a **front-end loaded** approach, the insurer **recovers the cost beforehand**, ensuring that the costs are mostly recovered early on regardless of whether or not the policy is lapsed.

$$
	\text{Allocated Premium(t)} = \text{Premium(t)} \cdot \text{Allocation Rate(t)}
$$

In a **back-end loaded** approach, the insurer will recover the remaining cost only when the insured lapses their policy. This is done via a **Surrender Charge**, which reduces the surrender value of the policy by a **specified proportion**.

$$
	\text{Surrender Value(t)} = \text{Fund Value(t)} \cdot \text{Surrender Charge Rate(t)}
$$

In both cases, the upfront costs will be **recovered over time** as long the policy remains in-force. Thus, the loading amount gradually decreases:

1. **Front Loaded**: Premium allocation gradually increases back to 100%
2. **Back Loaded**: Surrender charges gradually decrease to zero

!!! Note

	The period where surrender charges are applicable is typically known as a **Minimum or Initial Investment Period**.

	This is becaused it is assumed that the policyholder will not lapse during this period so as to avoid the surrender charge.

In both cases, premium allocation rates tend to **increase above 100%** after a certain period, incentivising the policyholder to retain their policy to get the additional value. 

The premium allocation schedule is typically **non-guaranteed**, but most insurers *floor* the allocation rates at 100%.

!!! Info

	MAS307 mandates that the term "Premium Allocation Rate" cannot be used in any communication to policyholders.

	This is because it implies that the allocated amount will be used to purchase units. However, in reality, the premiums are subject to further charges (as described below).

### **Premium Charges**

Premium Charges refer to the charges applicable to the **purchase of units**. The purpose of the charge is to **compensate the distributor** of the units, akin to a commission fee.

They are typically applied in the form of a **percentage reduction** of the amount of available premium to purcahse units:

$$
	\text{True Premium} = \text{Premium(t)} \cdot [1 - \text{Premium Charge(t)}]
$$

More generally, these charges come in one of two forms:

* **Sales Charge**: front end load applied to the transaction volumes
* **Bid-Offer Spread**: Difference between bid and offer prices

Both items are typically represented as a **percentage** (~5%).

!!! Note

	Bid Offer Spreads are a general financial concept:

	* **Bid Price**: Price that fund manager will bid for a unit (Policyholder sell price)
	* **Offer Price**: Price that the fund manager will offer for a unit (Policyholder buy price)

	The bid price will **always be lower** than the offer price, ensuring that there is a spread. This is to ensure that there is profit to be earned to incentivise distributors to trade the units.

### **Top Ups**

Apart from the normal premium schedule, policyholders can make **adhoc top-ups** into the policy.

Top-ups are subject to premium allocation and premium charges, but may have a different rate compared to Single/Regular premiums.

### **Mortality Charge**

### Annual Management Charge

### **Premium Holiday**

<!-- 

### **Premium Holiday**

This self-sustaining nature of the policy means that if policyholders choose not to pay premiums anymore, the policy will still be in-force as the necessary insurance charges are still being paid for by the fund value

If the policy is on premium holiday during the first 10 policy years, we will deduct a premium
holiday charge on a monthly basis from the account value
-->


### **Net Amount at Risk**

The Death and Surrender Benefit are **mutually exclusive** - the insurer will only end up paying only one in the end.

Thus, we can think about the death benefit at every period as the combination of the **Cash Value** of the policy and a **one period renewable term policy**. The coverage of this term policy is known as the **Net Amount at Risk** (NAR) and is the difference between the Death Benefit and the Cash Value. It represents the amount of money the insurer has to pay in the event of a claim, hence is *at risk* to the insurer.

$$
Death~Benefit = Cash~Value + Net~Amount~At~Risk
$$

![Permanent NAAR](Assets/1.%20Life%20Products.md/Permanent%20NAAR.png)

The premium for this term policy is known as the **Cost of Insurance (COI)**. It is the product of the **coverage of the policy** (NAAR) and the **cost per unit coverage** (COI Rate). It is typically some function of the mortality experience.

$$
Cost~Of~Insurance = COI~Rate * Net~Amount~At~Risk
$$





•	They typically also have a Waiting Period – A fixed amount of time from the purchase of the policy to when benefits will be paid out. Some policies also have a Deferred Period as well – a minimum amount of time that you must have been afflicted with the health condition before any claim can be made

Insureds are allowed to split their investments into **multiple different funds**, allowing them to diversify their exposure. They may also **adjust** their selection later on, which may be subject to an administrative fee. Some insurers **rebalance** the portfolio yearly to match the initial portfolio allocation.


### Bonus

Whenever there are charges posted to the policy, it will **sell units** to cover the charges. On top of the typical insurance related charges, they also contain **investment related charges** (Fund Management Charges, Expense Ratios etc).

 *Regardless* of the investment performance, the insurer will take a **fixed spread** from the investment.

> Note that it is often difficult to determine the actual price of the units used for allocations or charges as there is often a delay due to processing. The transaction may only occur a few days later, thus using the unit price then rather than when it was initiated.

The death benefit of the policy is the typically the **higher of the Account Value or a Capital Guarantee**, similar to Endowment Insurance. The NAAR of the policy is the Capital Guarantee less the Account Value. Thus, if the account value is sufficiently high, the **NAAR will be negative** and there will be **no mortality charges** on the policy.

The surrender benefit of the policy is only the account value.

$$
\displaylines{
Death~Benefit = Max (Account~Value, Capital~Guarantee) \\
NAAR = Capital~Guarantee - Account~Value
}
$$



## Annuity

## How do Annuities work?

Policyholders must first decide *when* they would like to start receiving for payments and for *how long*. The date they start receiving payments is known as the **Maturity Date** while the period between the point of purchase till maturity is the **Accumulation Period**.

Policyholders will pay premiums during the accumulation period, where they will then be invested in a fund. The value of the fund on the maturity date is known as the **Accumulation Value**.

Based on the accumulation value, the policy will then determine how much to pay out per month such that the fund value will be fully exhausted during the payment period.

Thus, annuities are generally known as **Savings products** as policyholders will contribute to the Annuity fund periodically to receive later withdraw from it.

They are typically (but not exclusively) used for retirement in the form of a *pension* where policyholders will make regular contributions to the fund while working and receive monthly payouts starting from retirement.


### **Endowment Insurance**

Endowment Insurance is a **Savings Oriented** permanent insurance policy but with a **limited policy period**, similar to term insurance. As its name suggests, the *primary* goal of Endowment Insurance is for the policy to Endow and provide a payout to the insured, which is why the policy period is limited. They are typically **participating** policies.

To compete with other similar savings products (Fixed Deposit etc), the amount paid into the policy must be *at least* the amount paid out, providing a **Capital Guarantee**. Thus, the SA of the policy is the **Savings Goal** chosen by the insured and is usually equal to the **sum of all premiums paid over the life of the policy**.

> The savings goal is the amount the insured wishes to *save*. Thus, the premiums paid over the life of the policy must be equal to this amount, akin to saving in a bank account to meet a target.

Unlike other policies, the death benefit is *NOT equal* to the SA. The death benefit is usually some function (~105%) of the total premiums paid *up till that point*, providing a capital guarantee as well.

The maturity benefit of the policy is usually the sum of the **SA and participating dividends**. The "interest" earned on the product is largely dependent on the performance of the participating fund.

<!-- Not all endowments are like this, SA could be lower but more NGTD benefits -->

Agents receive higher commissions for selling universal and other whole life policies than they do for selling less expensive term life insurance, leading to concerns about conflicts of interest.[6]

Proponents respond that it would be inaccurate to state that term insurance is less expensive than universal life, or for that matter, other forms of permanent life insurance, without qualifying the statement with the other factor: Time, or length of coverage.

While term life insurance is the least expensive over a short period, say one to twenty years, permanent life insurance is generally the least expensive over a longer period, or over one's entire lifetime. This is mainly due to the high percentage of the premiums paid out in commissions during the first 10–12 years

A well informed policyholder should understand that the flexibility of the policy is tied irrevocably to risk to the policyholder. The more guarantees a policy has, the more expensive its cost.



Potentially higher costs - VUL policies may be more expensive than other types of permanent insurance, such as Whole Life and traditional Universal Life. Volatility of cash surrender values, especially at late duration, can cause a "reverse dollar cost averaging" effect that results in higher costs of insurance charges. Proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk, but it cannot be completely eliminated.



Insurers Prefer Unit-Linked Policies
	Commissions for these unit linked policies are the highest – which incentivizes intermediaries to focus on them more compared to traditional products
	These commissions are intentionally set by the company – this means that insurers are trying to sell more unit-linked products
	This is possibly due to the lower risk borne by the insurer (No guaranteed benefits) which would subsequently reduce the regulatory requirements on the insurer
	However, another view is that the product is much more complex and is harder to explain to clients which warrants a higher commission on the intermediary’s end
Excessive charges
	COnsidered investment securities and must be given a proespectus
Must be sold by registered individuals who pass a financial exam



This makes a VL policy *potentially more attractive* than every other kind of policy. However, this is only true if the return on investments outpace both inflation and the investment return of the insurer. Although equity does earn substantially higher returns over a *long* period of time, **short term deviations** are inevitable and the policy value could drop substantially if the investments go bad.

lock your money up in all kinds of strange ways and do not compensate you for the illiquidity.











Interesting Insights from Annuities
No Underwriting Needed
•	Typically, no underwriting is needed for Annuity products
•	This is because the insurer prefers if you die earlier → Less annuity payments needed
•	Thus, they do not bother to check for your health → Encourages people of poor health to purchase them as well

Annuities as Pure Endowments
•	A pure endowment (different from regular endowment insurance) is one that pays out a maturity benefit
•	Purchasing an Annuity is akin to purchasing multiple pure endowments of different terms up to the policy term of the annuity

Male-Female Mortality Differences
•	In general, Males have higher Mortality than Females
o	Males tend to live shorter lives; Females tend to live longer lives
•	All else equals, this means that:

Whole life insurance can provide a foundation to allow the household to spend more and still be able to provide a bequest, or to increase spending even further by using the cash value as a volatility buffer for the investment portfolio

	Since these risks are related to the life of the policyholder, the only way for an insurer to properly assess their risks are through a medical examination & questionnaires, known as medical underwriting

Anticipated Endowment - Similar to a bond

annuity is chaging longevity for credit risk
because the insurer must be solvent throughout that period to receive the payments


Even if the insured does not pay the required premiums on the payment date, the insurer usually offers a **Grace Period** (~1 Month) from that date where they will accept the required payment with **no other penalty or requirement**. If the insured still does not pay the premiums by the end of the grace period, then the policy will **Lapse** - it is no longer in effect and the insurer will not respond to any claims made.

Buy for more than the surrender value
The new owner takes on responsibility for future premium payments and collects the maturity value when the policy matures or the death benefit when the original life assured dies. Policyholders who sell their policies no longer benefit from the life cover and should consider whether to take out alternative cover.
Investors will pay more than the surrender value because the policy has greater value if it is kept in force than if it is terminated early.
