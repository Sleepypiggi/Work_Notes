# **Health Insurance Products**

Health insurance is meant to protect against the financial risk of being afflicted with a *temporary or permanent* health condition.

The financial risk can be broadly classified into:

1. *Insufficient* financial resources to cover healthcare related costs
2. *Loss of income* due to being unable to work as a result of a health condition

The range of possible health conditions is extremely broad, thus the range of possible financial impacts is broad as well:

* Low but frequent expenses - EG. Common Flu
* High but rare expenses - EG. Surgery

Most people can afford to bear the former from their salary or savings, but few are able to bear the latter - which is the main focus of Health Insurance.

## **Health Insurance Features**

### **Cost Sharing Mechanisms**

There are several cost sharing mechanisms in place:

| Mechanism | Explanation |
|:-:|:-:|
| **Co-Payment** | Part of the expense that must be paid by the individual no matter what |
| **Deductible**  | Portion of the *remaining expense* that must be paid by the individual before any insurance benefits |
| **Co-Insurance** | Portion of the *remaining expense* that must be paid on top of the deductible |
| **Claim Limit** | *Maximum* amount that the insurance will cover over a period; any excess is paid by the individual |

Note that Co-payments do NOT count towards the Deductible; hence the word `remaining` is used.

These mechanisms are meant to *discourage* individuals from choosing *expensive providers* and discourage them from seeking *excessive treatment*. This reduces the cost to insurers, allowing them to keep premiums affordable.

However, some criticism is that these mechanisms may discourage individuals from seeking *seemingly* minor treatments, which could possibly snowball into something more serious, resulting in an *even larger claim* for the insurer (counterproductive).

### **Panel Doctors**

Health insurance claims are made *through healthcare providers* rather than from the individual to the insurer. This is so that individuals do not need to fork out a large lump sum of cash for treatment; Healthcare providers will claim against your insurance to recover the cost of treatment instead.

Given this arrangement, people will only go to providers where their insurance plan covers them. Insurers prefer lower healthcare costs to manage their costs while healthcare providers want to charge a high cost in order to increase their profits.

Insurers want to cover only the lowest cost providers, but needs to have a sufficiently wide coverage for their policyholders. Similarly, healthcare providers want to charge the highest possible cost, but needs to be covered by an insurer for sufficient demand.

Thus, insurers typically make a *deal* with healthcare providers such that they provide cover for them in exchange for lower cost - a balance between the two parties interest. These providers are often known as **Network Providers**.

Most policies provide *better coverage* for network providers or *only cover* network providers. Higher premiums may be charged for coverage outside of the insurers network.

## **Singapore Health Insurance System**

Healthcare is a *public sector* and as such depends heavily on the socio-political environment of the country. As a result, different countries have different healthcare systems & hence different health insurance landscape.

Singapore provides *government subsidised* public healthcare for all services. Specifically for hospitalization expenses, individuals are put through *means testing* to determine the level of subsidy provided.

The means testing is dependent on the *type of ward* chosen - only class C and B2 wards are eligible for subsidies. Within these two categories, the final amount is dependent on their monthly income.

### **Medishield Life**

Singapore has a basic *national* Medical Expense insurance plan for all Singaporeans and PRs known as **Medishield Life**. It is automatically paid for from the **Medisave account** under CPF, who manages the policy.

It is designed to *partially reimburse basic public healthcare costs*, but can also be used to *partially reimburse* certain private costs as well, capped at what it would have been in the public sector.

Individuals can additionally purchase a *private* health insurance plan that works on top of Medishield, collectively known as an **Integrated Shield Plan**.

Instead of paying two seperate premiums, only **one premium** needs to be paid to the private insurer, who will pass on the Medishield portion to CPF. Medisave can be used to pay the entire medishield portion, as well as part of the private portion.

The integrated plan naturally covers a wider range of health conditions with higher reimbursements.

### **MediFund**

Singapore's *social safety net* program is known as **MediFund**, which covers only the most basic of services. It is provided on a case by case basis, typically when the Medisave account has been depleted.

It is by definition, a safety net - meant to catch people who are falling to prevent them from dying, but not meant to return them to where they fell from.

It provides a minimum amount of welfare that the government has agreed nobody should fall below.

Introduction to Health Insurance

•	The policy also has a unique exclusion – Pre-existing conditions. Any existing illness or disability at the time of purchase (Known to you or not) will not be covered by the policy. Therefore, it is advised to buy health insurance when you are still young and healthy

Types of Health Insurance
By Policy Benefits
Reimbursements	Fixed Benefits	Graded Benefits
Pays out an amount equal to the cost of healthcare treatment	Pays out a fixed amount regardless of the severity of Health Conditions	Pays out an amount proportional to the severity of Health Condition

By Policy Coverage
Medical Expense Insurance	Reimburses the policyholder in the event they require medical treatment
Hospitalisation Insurance	Pays out a fixed benefit to the policyholder for each day they are hospitalized, on top of any existing Medical Expense Claims made

Within each type, it can be further broken down by severity but varies according to insurer. Not all severities of Critical Illnesses are covered


Group Health Insurance
•	Health Insurance is also often bought as a Group for employers to cover their Employees (and sometimes their dependents’) healthcare
•	No individual medical underwriting is needed; the insurer assumes underwrites according to the profile of the group as a whole
•	As such, these plans typically offer simple coverage for medical reimbursement etc 

Health Insurance insights
•	Due to an aging population and lower household sizes globally, there will be an increasing need for medical care which makes Health Insurance important
•	Health insurance is something everybody feels they don’t need it until they do. But by the time you realise it, your illness will no longer be covered or too expensive to cover
•	Thus, get health insurance when you are young and healthy – Premiums are bound to go up over time as you age and fall sick, but at least you are covered

Medishield LIfe
covers everything, but got limits on the payout
anything above we need to pay ourselves
Private insurance provides as charge cover for the excess
however, we are responsible for about 5-10% of the payment subject to a cap

Health not like other insurance because you visit multiple times a year, with unknown costs each time

Need to have personal insurance because relying on just company insurance is bad
Ties you to the company, cant quit unless u got job etc, they can threaten to cut etc
