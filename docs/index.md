# **Actuarial Work Notes**

Hello!

This website is meant to a be a repository of the notes that I have made for work, allowing me to reference them on the go.

The notes were created by blending together information from multiple resources. The information is what I understand of the topic and thus should not be taken as fact.

Additionally, it is meant to be an educational resource and should NOT be taken as financial advice regarding insurance.

All images used in this website are credited in the raw markdown files that were used to build the website. If there are any issues with the use of the images, please reach out to me via Github.
