# **Insurance Overview**

## **Understanding Insurance**

From an economic perspective, every individual owns several assets (wealth, health, wisdom etc) over their life cycle that they must manage to survive, which can be measured through their **financial value**.

As much as we would like to have full control over our lives, every activity has some dependency on some *uncertain factors* that are beyond our control. This could possibly lead to *unexpected* events that changes the value of our assets, for better or for worse.

These events would thus cause a **difference in value** of our *internally expected value* and the *actually realized value* of the assets. In the unfortunate case that it would lead to a *loss of value*, then this possibility of financial loss is known as **Risk**.

**Insurance** is the *transfer* of the uncertain financial loss (risk) from one entity to another, in exchange for certain **smaller payments** to the entity that takes on the risk.

* The entity transferring the risk is known as the **Insured**.
* The entity bearing the risk is known as the **Insurer**.
* The certain smaller payments are known as **Premiums**.
* When the Insured experiences financial loss, they can make a **Claim** from the Insurer to be *compensated* for the loss.

From the perspective of the Insured, Insurance helps to exchange a larger uncertain loss for a smaller certain loss, thereby **reducing their uncertainty**.

This is why Insurance is known as the *business of uncertainty*, as the demand and supply for insurance depend on it:

* If the Insured knows for certain that an event *would not occur*, then they would not demand insurance.
* If the Insurer knows for certain that the event *would occur*, then they would not supply insurance.
* It is because there is uncertainty present that there is a market for insurance.

> Insurance is just one of the ways of managing uncertainty/risk. It would be good to have a working understanding about alternatives, but that is currently out of scope for this set of notes.

The details of an insurance agreement between two entities is formally expressed within a *contract* known as a **Insurance Policy**. The duration which the insurance policy is valid is known as the **Policy Term**. Ammendments to the policy (Addittion, Removal or Modification of coverage) can be made through an **Endorsement/Rider**.

## **Types of Insurance Policies**

We can categorize insurance policies in many ways. The most common classification is **based on the type of risk** they insure against:

| Life Insurance | General Insurance |
| :-: | :-: |
| Risks related to human life or health | All other material risks not related to human life or health |
| Mortality, Longevity & Morbidity Risk | Property Losses, Liability Losses or Workers Compensations |
| Long term policies (>3 years) | Short term policies (~1 year) |

Note that some may add a third category - **Health Insurance**. However, in many countries it is grouped under either of the two. In the UK, it is grouped with General Insurance while in the US it is grouped with Life insurance. For the purposes of this guide, we consider it as its own category of insurance and will be covered more extensively in its own section.

There are many specific kinds of policies under each category that will be further explored in their respective section.

Alternatively, they may also be classified **based on who purchases** the insurance:

| Personal Insurance | Commercial Insurance |
| :-: | :-: |
| Purchased by individuals | Purchased by businesses |
| Auto Insurance |  |
| More regulated | Less regulated |

Commercial Insurance is less regulated as businesses are generally better equipped to look after their own interests - having the resources to obtain professionals to determine if an insurance policy is suitable for them. Most individuals do not have the resources to do so and thus require **laws to protect them**.

Lastly, it can also be classified **based on who provides** the insurance:

| Private Insurance | Social Insurance |
| :-: | :-: |
| Provided by businesses | Provided by the government |
| People have to actively purchase it | Citizens are automatically enrolled in it |
| Goal of being Equitable | Goal of Income Redistribution |

Private Insurance that is compulsory to purchase (EG. Auto Insurance) is often *confused* with social insurance since both are related to the government. However, they are still provided for by different parties and should be treated differently under this classification.

## Why Insurance

From the beginning of human civilization we have sought to reduce uncertainty/risk
this was the basis of forming clans, tribes and other groups
The group helps their loss fortunate members in times of crisis, which reduces the volatility of access to resources

The concept has not changed - we still engage in activity today that involves as acting in a group - employer, government or insurance firm etc
In some ways, we are even more vulnerable than our ancestors
The resources that used to be provided for by the tribe is reduced
Need a more formalized way to reduce ris

Why should you get insurance?
•	Unexpected things happen at unexpected times with unexpected consequences
•	An effective way to handle this risk it to transfer it to someone else → Insurance
o	From a behavioural economics perspective, most individuals are Risk Averse – Concave Utility function
o	They would much rather prefer a fixed payment rather than an uncertain loss, which is why they would choose to use insurance

Why is Insurance Important for the economy?
•	All activities entail some level of risk – Especially those that keep our society running
o	Without insurance, people would be wearier of these risks and thus engage in these activities much less frequently, slowing down societal growth
•	Most of the time, the risks faced are huge – Car accidents, House fires, worker injury etc
o	Without insurance, you would have to set aside a large amount of capital to be able to pay off these potential liabilities at any moment, reducing the amount of capital that is spent to spur and drive the economy
o	Even if you were to save or invest your own capital, these potential losses could pile up into insane amounts which most people will never be able to reach
•	If insurers start to fall and people lose trust in the insurance system, it could threaten the stability of our economy, as seen in the 2008 Financial Crisis. There is why the insurance sector was deemed to be of Systemic Risk and AIG was “Too big to Fail”
