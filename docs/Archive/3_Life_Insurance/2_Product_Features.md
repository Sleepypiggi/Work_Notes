# **Product Features**

This section is meant to dive deeper into commonly found product features within each major product category.

## **Term**


 










•	They typically also have a Waiting Period – A fixed amount of time from the purchase of the policy to when benefits will be paid out. Some policies also have a Deferred Period as well – a minimum amount of time that you must have been afflicted with the health condition before any claim can be made

Insureds are allowed to split their investments into **multiple different funds**, allowing them to diversify their exposure. They may also **adjust** their selection later on, which may be subject to an administrative fee. Some insurers **rebalance** the portfolio yearly to match the initial portfolio allocation.

Whenever there are charges posted to the policy, it will **sell units** to cover the charges. On top of the typical insurance related charges, they also contain **investment related charges** (Fund Management Charges, Expense Ratios etc).

 *Regardless* of the investment performance, the insurer will take a **fixed spread** from the investment.

> Note that it is often difficult to determine the actual price of the units used for allocations or charges as there is often a delay due to processing. The transaction may only occur a few days later, thus using the unit price then rather than when it was initiated.

The death benefit of the policy is the typically the **higher of the Account Value or a Capital Guarantee**, similar to Endowment Insurance. The NAAR of the policy is the Capital Guarantee less the Account Value. Thus, if the account value is sufficiently high, the **NAAR will be negative** and there will be **no mortality charges** on the policy.

The surrender benefit of the policy is only the account value.

## Annuity

## How do Annuities work?

Policyholders must first decide *when* they would like to start receiving for payments and for *how long*. The date they start receiving payments is known as the **Maturity Date** while the period between the point of purchase till maturity is the **Accumulation Period**.

Policyholders will pay premiums during the accumulation period, where they will then be invested in a fund. The value of the fund on the maturity date is known as the **Accumulation Value**.

Based on the accumulation value, the policy will then determine how much to pay out per month such that the fund value will be fully exhausted during the payment period.

Thus, annuities are generally known as **Savings products** as policyholders will contribute to the Annuity fund periodically to receive later withdraw from it.

They are typically (but not exclusively) used for retirement in the form of a *pension* where policyholders will make regular contributions to the fund while working and receive monthly payouts starting from retirement.


### **Endowment Insurance**

Endowment Insurance is a **Savings Oriented** permanent insurance policy but with a **limited policy period**, similar to term insurance. As its name suggests, the *primary* goal of Endowment Insurance is for the policy to Endow and provide a payout to the insured, which is why the policy period is limited. They are typically **participating** policies.

To compete with other similar savings products (Fixed Deposit etc), the amount paid into the policy must be *at least* the amount paid out, providing a **Capital Guarantee**. Thus, the SA of the policy is the **Savings Goal** chosen by the insured and is usually equal to the **sum of all premiums paid over the life of the policy**.

> The savings goal is the amount the insured wishes to *save*. Thus, the premiums paid over the life of the policy must be equal to this amount, akin to saving in a bank account to meet a target.

Unlike other policies, the death benefit is *NOT equal* to the SA. The death benefit is usually some function (~105%) of the total premiums paid *up till that point*, providing a capital guarantee as well.

The maturity benefit of the policy is usually the sum of the **SA and participating dividends**. The "interest" earned on the product is largely dependent on the performance of the participating fund.

Agents receive higher commissions for selling universal and other whole life policies than they do for selling less expensive term life insurance, leading to concerns about conflicts of interest.[6]

Proponents respond that it would be inaccurate to state that term insurance is less expensive than universal life, or for that matter, other forms of permanent life insurance, without qualifying the statement with the other factor: Time, or length of coverage.

While term life insurance is the least expensive over a short period, say one to twenty years, permanent life insurance is generally the least expensive over a longer period, or over one's entire lifetime. This is mainly due to the high percentage of the premiums paid out in commissions during the first 10–12 years

A well informed policyholder should understand that the flexibility of the policy is tied irrevocably to risk to the policyholder. The more guarantees a policy has, the more expensive its cost.



Potentially higher costs - VUL policies may be more expensive than other types of permanent insurance, such as Whole Life and traditional Universal Life. Volatility of cash surrender values, especially at late duration, can cause a "reverse dollar cost averaging" effect that results in higher costs of insurance charges. Proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk, but it cannot be completely eliminated.



Insurers Prefer Unit-Linked Policies
	Commissions for these unit linked policies are the highest – which incentivizes intermediaries to focus on them more compared to traditional products
	These commissions are intentionally set by the company – this means that insurers are trying to sell more unit-linked products
	This is possibly due to the lower risk borne by the insurer (No guaranteed benefits) which would subsequently reduce the regulatory requirements on the insurer
	However, another view is that the product is much more complex and is harder to explain to clients which warrants a higher commission on the intermediary’s end
Excessive charges
	COnsidered investment securities and must be given a proespectus
Must be sold by registered individuals who pass a financial exam



This makes a VL policy *potentially more attractive* than every other kind of policy. However, this is only true if the return on investments outpace both inflation and the investment return of the insurer. Although equity does earn substantially higher returns over a *long* period of time, **short term deviations** are inevitable and the policy value could drop substantially if the investments go bad.

Interesting Insights from Annuities
No Underwriting Needed
•	Typically, no underwriting is needed for Annuity products
•	This is because the insurer prefers if you die earlier → Less annuity payments needed
•	Thus, they do not bother to check for your health → Encourages people of poor health to purchase them as well

Annuities as Pure Endowments
•	A pure endowment (different from regular endowment insurance) is one that pays out a maturity benefit
•	Purchasing an Annuity is akin to purchasing multiple pure endowments of different terms up to the policy term of the annuity

Male-Female Mortality Differences
•	In general, Males have higher Mortality than Females
o	Males tend to live shorter lives; Females tend to live longer lives
•	All else equals, this means that:
o	Males have a higher Mortality Risk and pay more insurance premiums
o	Males have lower Longevity Risk and pay lower annuity premiums
•	Highlights the difference between Insurance and Annuity style products

Whole life insurance can provide a foundation to allow the household to spend more and still be able to provide a bequest, or to increase spending even further by using the cash value as a volatility buffer for the investment portfolio

	Since these risks are related to the life of the policyholder, the only way for an insurer to properly assess their risks are through a medical examination & questionnaires, known as medical underwriting

Anticipated Endowment - Similar to a bond

annuity is chaging longevity for credit risk
because the insurer must be solvent throughout that period to receive the payments


Even if the insured does not pay the required premiums on the payment date, the insurer usually offers a **Grace Period** (~1 Month) from that date where they will accept the required payment with **no other penalty or requirement**. If the insured still does not pay the premiums by the end of the grace period, then the policy will **Lapse** - it is no longer in effect and the insurer will not respond to any claims made.



## **Medical Underwriting**

<!-- Evidence of insurability
Guaranteed Issuance Offer (GIO)
	Plans that do NOT require you to undergo medical underwriting – in other words it will be offered no matter what and will cover everything
	However, the death benefit is often capped at a low amount & will only take effect after a short waiting period of 2-3 years
	The premiums are also much higher than a regular policy, which means that this policy is only for the truly desperate 

Pre-existing Condition” is the existence of any signs or symptoms for which treatment, medication, consultation,
advice or diagnosis has been sought or received by the life assured or would have caused an ordinary prudent
person to seek treatment, diagnosis or cure, prior to the Cover Start Date or date of reinstatement (if any) of this
benefit.

## **Second Hand Policies**

Endowment selling
Buy for more than the surrender value
The new owner takes on responsibility for future premium payments and collects the maturity value when the policy matures or the death benefit when the original life assured dies. Policyholders who sell their policies no longer benefit from the life cover and should consider whether to take out alternative cover.
Investors will pay more than the surrender value because the policy has greater value if it is kept in force than if it is terminated early.
