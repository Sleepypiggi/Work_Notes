# **Introduction to Actuarial Science**

## **Overview**

It is a *multi-disciplinary* field that has elements of Finance, Statistics and Economics to model and quantify the financial impact of uncertain events - *Risk*.

Practitioners of Actuarial Science are financial services professionals, known as Actuaries. They typically work in the insurance industry, thus are commonly known as **insurance professionals**.

## **Becoming an Actuary**

To earn the professional designation of "Actuary", we have to go through a series of rigorous examinations governed by a professional body known as an **Actuarial Society**.

Passing all the examinations allows one to gain membership in the society, earning an Actuarial title. There are two tiers of membership, based on how many examinations were completed:

* Associate of the Society (EG. Associate of the Society of Actuaries, ASA)
* Fellow of the Society (EG. Fellow of the Society of Actuaries, FSA)

### **Actuarial Societies**

Each country typically has their own Actuarial Society to oversee the Actuaries working within. For instance, Singapore has our own [Singapore Actuarial Society](https://www.actuaries.org.sg/).

However, not all societies offer examinations to become credentialed as an Actuary. Out of those that do, only a few are strongly recognised in Singapore:

* [Society of Actuaries](https://www.soa.org/) - SOA, United States
* [Casaulty Actuarial Society](https://www.casact.org/) - CAS, United States
* [Canadian Institure of Actuaries](https://www.cia-ica.ca/home) - CIA, Canada
* [Institute and Faculty of Actuaries](https://actuaries.org.uk/) - IFOA, United Kingdom
* [Institute of Actuaries of Australia](https://www.actuaries.asn.au/) - IAA, Australia

It typically does not matter which society we become credentialled unders as most *employers* will honour credentials from any of the above.

!!! Note

    Note that being a fellow in one society does not make officially a fellow in another; there is no formal mutual recognition in that sense.

Naturally, the choice of society is obvious if we are already living in the region. For those outside, the choice typically boils down to accessibility or university program.

### **Actuarial Programs**

In Singapore, we are fortunate that all societies offer examinations here. Thus, the choice mostly boils down to university program.

Actuarial programs in university typically offer courses aim to equip students with the necessary knowledge to take the **first few** examinations. Each university in Singapore focuses on taking examinations with a different society:

| Singapore Management University | Nanyang Technological University | National University of Singapore |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Economics Second Major | Business Specialisation | Economics special program |
| SOA | IFOA | IAA |
| No Exemptions | Exemptions | Exemptions |

As alluded to above, some universities have collaborations with the respective societies to allow university courses to be used as *examination credit* (given a sufficiently high grade), allowing them to be exempted from taking those examinations.

However, this also means that the examinations are partly regulated by the society and will be significantly harder than normal. As a result, there is no guarantee of scoring well enough for an exemption. Overall GPA/CAP will also be at risk, making it hard to switch out as well.

Thus, it is not necessarily advantageous to go for programs that offer exemptions - it is a **double-edged sword**.

### **Self Studying**

Regardless of University, NONE of them will be able to fully prepare students for taking on all the examinations. We will eventually have to study for the more advanced examinations from scratch on our own. **Thus, it takes a lot of time and commitment to become an Actuary**.

This also means that we do not necessarily need a degree in Actuarial Science to become an Actuary - anyone in any phase of life can decide to transition into it by studying for it.

## **Actuarial Career**

### **Reasons to become an Actuary**

#### **Clear Career Path**

Unlike other fields of study where people struggle to know what they want to do, where they want to work, the gameplan is the same for all aspiring Actuaries - take actuarial examinations, learn about insurance and work in an insurance company!

Most companies offers study benefits that increases our salary for each exam passed. Unlike other fields where social and technical skills are necessary to progress, even an average performing Actuary can progress their career by just studying - which they have full control over when and how they want to do so.

Actuaries may not earn as much as the *top* investment banker, but will definitely earn more than the *worst* one. Along similar lines, this also means that the average Actuary will tend to earn more than the average white collar worker.

#### **High Job Security**

Insurance companies are *mandated* to have a credentialled Actuary sign off on its reserves every quarter. Most insurance companies are too large for a single Actuary to settle all the work - thus, a team of Actuaries will always be required.

Insurance has an over 200 year history and is one of the backbones of our modern financial system. A single company may fall, but it is *very unlikely* for the entire industry to collapse in the foreseeable future.

Actuarial credentials are recognised globally. Since Insurance is fundamentally the same, this allows Actuaries to work anywhere in the world.

Furthermore, there are many exit opportunities to other disciplines within Insurance or other parts of the Financial Industry as well where Actuarial background will be beneficial.

#### **Work Environment**

The best thing about Actuarial is getting to work with other Actuaries.

Actuarial is an extremely meritocractic profession. Anyone can bullshit on their resume or smooth talk during an interview, but not everyone can pass exams.

Getting a professional designation shows determination, proven knowledge and rigor, which creates a high barrier to entry that keeps "clowns" out of the profession. Thus, your colleagues are likely to be similar to yourself - direct & low bullshit, making it easy to work with them.

Similarly, due to the high barriers to entry, Actuarial is very insulated from competitive pressures, thus it is possible to go coast (slang for *proceeding without effort*) and still do fine.

#### **Low Risk**

Actuarial pay is fairly standardized - if you pass `x` exams in `y` years, you will earn `z` dollars with little variance, making it a *low-risk profession*.

Furthemore, the industry has remained *largely unchanged* over the years - only the regulation and tools have developed slightly. Some may argue that this is boring but others will love the *long term predictability* of the career.

It is thus a great career for *risk averse individuals* who are willing to accept the lower pay in exchange for certainty and other qualitative benefits.

### **Reasons NOT to become an Actuary**

#### **High Opportunity Cost**

In order to reap the full benefits of the career, we must continually study and take exams till we become a Fellow. This occurs a *huge opportunity cost* as we could have used the time spent studying on other aspects of life.

There are about 10 exams which each taking about 4-6 months of preparation, assuming we do not fail. Higher level exams are also offered only once a year, meaning that an unfortunate failure could push you back a whole year. It often *takes years* for someone to become a fellow.

Conventional advice is to take most of the examinations *as soon as possible* while we are still fresh out of university with minimal commitments. However, this also means that while most of our peers are enjoying their youth, we spend most of days preparing for examinations. By the time we are finished and ready to enjoy, most of our peers would have begun to settle down.

If we instead decide to enjoy life first, then other life commitments like starting a family may get in the way - making it hard to effectively study for exams. Either way, a tradeoff has to be made.

#### **Greener Grass**

There are many other professions out there that pay just as well or better than Actuarial, WITHOUT the need to take exams - EG. Big Tech, High Finance etc.

The most common argument is that if you have the intellect and determination to pass rigorous exams, you have a decent chance at breaking into these roles if you put your mind to it.

However, there are no barriers to entry in these fields, making it extremely competitive. Only those who are hardworking with the best skills & some luck are able to succeed.

Furthermore, these industries (especially tech) are fast paced and innovative - although that makes the work more interesting, it also requires you to constantly put in the time and effort to keep up with the latest developments in the market. Failing to do so will result in you getting left behind quickly.

#### **Worklife Balance**

Counting all the study hours as working hours, this leads to Actuarial having an extremely poor worklife balance *before* fellowship.

Coupled with the immense stress and anxiety involved in taking examinations, there are definitely better jobs out there.

The great paradox of this profession is that in order to get work life balance, one must first give up worklife balance. Similarly, to get a well paying job that requires little effort, one must first get an average paying job that requires a lot of effort.

## **Important Traits**

### **Business Sense**

There is a *common misconception* that people who are good at studying or likes math will do well in the career. This is largely due to the difficult credentialling process which requires a large amount of studying and mathematical skills.

However, in practice, the math itself is nowhere near as complicated as the examinations - it mostly involves basic arithmetic done using Excel or a Programming language.

Similarly, unlike in examinations, there is NEVER a *definitive* right or wrong answer - there is a lot of *business sense* surrounding the numbers. A large portion of the work involves communicating or justifying results to various stakeholders - who are often not as technically inclined.

Thus, people who will do well in the career are those with a strong understanding of the business who can link their findings to the *bigger picture* and decisively act on it.

Unfortunately, most people who are attracted to this job are those who tend to be *very good at academics but nothing much else* as they like the idea of getting paid to study (what they are good at) - which is not the type of people who will excel in the career.

### **Technical Skills**

As mentioned, a lot of the day to day work involves using various software to manipulate data. The most common tool used is **Microsoft Excel**, as it allows us to view and manipulate the data at the smae time.

However, as the industry grows, datasets become *increasingly larger* and thus we need software stronger and faster than Excel to work with the data - programming (VBA/SQL/R/Python/Scala/Java).

Many Actuarial curriculums are beginning to include programming. However, many of them do not go deep enough into fundamental concepts of programming, just the barebones of how to operate the language.

Some argue that people are *too focused* on developing technical skills as in 10 years time they are unlikely to be looking at spreadsheets or code often - just the results. Thus, there is a need to strike a **balance between taking exams, picking up technical skills and acquiring business knowledge**.

### **Exit Opportunities**

Actuaries are regarded as Insurance Professionals - thus, it is possible to move horizontally to *other functions* within the industry to find success as well (Finance, Underwriting etc). Similarly, it is also possible to move into a different industry (EG. Banking) but handling the insurance aspect of the business as well.

The Actuarial skillset is extremely diverse and is very transferrable outside the insurance industry. The issue is that the profession has poor marketing - most people do not know what an Actuary is and much less what they are capable of, making it hard to find opportunities outside of insurance.

This is the *biggest risk* of the Actuarial career path. If the insurance industry collapses or if you decide you no longer want it, it will be hard to move out due to how specialized the career is. Thus, do not expect to be able to break into other industries after some years of experience.

Even if there are opportunities to move, most would not go down that path as they have spent a significant amount of time and effort to be a credentialled actuary (Sunk Cost Fallacy).

## **Data Science and Actuarial**

Some people are concerned that Actuaries would be replaced by Data Scientists in the near future. After all, both professions seemingly involve analyzing large volumes of data to make predictions about the future.

However, the two roles are fundamentally different. An Actuary is more of a business analyst that makes use of some statistical theory, while data scientists are statisticians who apply their work to a business context.

The issue with Data Science is that most of its cutting edge methods are often black boxes - there is no strong business intuition why it works, it just does. This is especially problematic in insurance due to the highly regulated and complicated nature of the industry as it is hard to justify the results.

What makes an Actuary valuable is their ability to analyze and explain the results to key stakeholders like Management or Regulators. Actuarial methods may not be as accurate as modern methods, but they are driven by underlying economic intuition (consistent) rather than sourced from the data (inconsistent).

Thus, it is unlikely that Data Scientists will replace Actuaries. It is more likely that these data scientists will work under actuaries to manipulate the increasing large volume of data, while actuaries synthesise the results to a business context.

However, this makes it all the more important for the Actuarial skillset to expand towards more *programming* for them to perform these tasks themselves, or make it eaier to communicate with their data science subordinates.

Actuaries help to quantify risk in a way that is material to the business > Gives companies incentives to adopt safer ways of working or avoid dangerous situations all together

Life insurasnce gives people the peace of mind that if people were to die, their dependents wont immediately into fall into financial ruin
Actuaries determine how to best set the premiums so that people can get their best deserved benefits while keeping it affordable for all

Before actuaries, there were a lot of scam insurance companies that offered low rates, ran away with it when they didnt have money or went bankcrupt
Regulation exists because of shit like this, need to have reserves signed off by Actuaries
