# Credentialling Process (USA Focused)

The US has two societies due to differences in the 1900s. Originally there was only the SOA, but the P&C actuaries felt that their needs were not being met and hence started the CAS. Attempts have been made to recombine the two, but none have succeeded thus far.

Within the US, SOA is mainly recognised for Life and Health insurance while the CAS is recognised for P&C insurance. CAS is not as well known outside of the US, thus SOA may be recognised for all lines of insurance. However, this exception is likely to fade away within the next few years as CAS expands internationally.

Despite being seperate societies, the first two examinations are shared between both societies - a credit from the SOA can count towards CAS. Thus, to avoid wasting resources, conventional advice is to clear the shared examinations and then decide which society to pursue based on your first job.

## **Which society to choose?**

Most people do not have a strong opinion about which line they end up in (Life vs Non-Life), so long as they have a job.

Due to the specialized nature of the industry, very few people have sufficient working experience on both sides of the industry to form a proper opinion on which they prefer. Every comparison will thus be based on hearsay or limited experience - which should be taken with a pinch of salt.

Thus, as stated in the previous section, conventional advice is to base the decision off where you start your first **full-time** job! It is NOT recommended to base it off internship experience alone as you could end up working in a completely different line post graduation no matter how many internships were done.

## **How many examinations to complete by graduation?**

Most job postings do not have a hard requirement on the number of examinations that need to be completed - most simply state "good progress in actuarial examinations".

For graduates, this usually translates to about ~2-3 examinations completed. After a few years of experience, this could potentially mean an Associate level or close to attaining it.

There are two main reasons why stopping at 2-3 examinations is ideal:

* **Job Opportunities** - Having the maximum number of shared examinations completed provides the most opportunities in terms of employment.
* **Overpriced** - Having too many examinations completed without the relevant work experience to back it up may result in you being too expensive for the company to hire.

Most people usually indicate the next examination they intend to take on thei Resume, showing that the are motivated and planning ahead. Naturally, this should be tailored towards the company - Life jobs should list an SOA examination while non-life jobs should list a CAS one.

It generally does not matter which track is taken - it usually boils down to which your company is willing to pay for. If given a choice, it is optimal to a choose a track related to your field.

This is because the whole point of being an Actuary is to be an expert in that line of insurance. Taking a related track will help deepen understanding in that field, directly benefitting your career.

However, for people taking the exams outside of the US, it may not be as beneficial as some parts of the exam are tailored specifically towards the US market and reegulations, which may not be applicable back home.

## **Examination Order**

The examinations listed above is the order that is recommended by the SOA/CAS based on what they believe will provide the smoothest learning curve.

There are almost no pre-requisites to the exams, thus giving us the flexibility to choose how we want to approach it. However, there are some points to consider:

1. **Related exams** should also be taken one after another to ease the studying process as previous information is still fresh (FAM - ALTAM, SRM - PA - ATPA).

2. **Earlier examinations** are more *theoretical* while later ones are more *practical* to the job. Some say that it is a good idea to take the practical ones first to help you on the job, while others argue that you should clear theoretical ones first while you are still fresh out of university.

3. If there are **new examinations**, it is generally best to take the *older* ones first as there is suffificent history to know what to expect. On the other hand, some people argue that the first few sittings may be simpler or more lenient as the society attempts to gauge the difficulty of the exam.

## **1.6 Pathway Changes**

<!--
Why does the SOA/CAS keep changing the Examination Pathway?
	· Both the SOA/CAS mainly earn money by collecting Examination Fees from candidates, with some minor passive income from existing Associates & Fellows
	· In order to increase revenue, they have to ensure that more people want to take the examinations
	· Their main way of doing this is by adjusting the Examination pathway to suit the popular career trends at the time:
		○ When being a Quant was popular, they included more Quant style examinations to attract people
			§ EG. IFM & QFI Fellow Track
		○ When being a Data Scientist was popular, they included more data examinations to attract people
			§ EG. SRM, PA, ATPA, OC3
		○ Their main concern was that the people who would usually pursue Actuarial Science would end up pursuing these other professions instead, thus by including the other aspects, they may end up choosing Actuarial Science instead
	· Another way of doing this is to make it "easier" to enter the field:
		○ They have been gradually reducing the difficulty of the entry level examinations
		○ This makes it more likely that prospective candidates will stay on and attempt higher level and more expensive examinations
		○ Micro-Credentials help to keep prospective candidates motivated to at least complete the micro-credential and hopefully continue on the wider path
	· From a less money oriented standpoint, the examinations are meant to equip future Actuaries with the skill they need (Professional Relevance) - thus, the current examination pathway must try to reflect potential future developments in the field (Even if they don’t seem relevant right now!)
-->

## **Exam Technicalities**

Each exam has a question pool, with each question having an associated difficulty level. Whenever a candidate sits for an exam, the questions are pulled from the pool to form the the exam. To ensure fairness, statistical scaling methods are used to ensure that exams generated within the same sitting are around the same difficulty level.

Based on the overall difficulty of the exam generated, a pass mark is determined. It typically requires around 71% of the questions to be correct to pass. Based on our actual score, we are then grading accordingly to the scoring table below.

Additionally, there will be two types of questions in each exam:

* **Actual Questions** - Counted towards the overall grade
* **Pilot Questions** - Not counted towards overall grade; for SOA to gauge difficulty only

Thus, it may NOT be possible to obtain a score above a certain grade due to these pilots. For instance, If the exam was relatively easy with a passing mark of 21, but there are only 28 countable questions, then it is impossible to obtain grade 10 which requires 29 points!

All this information was sourced based on Excerpts within the SOA syllabus (2022):

> As part of the computer-based testing process, a few pilot questions will be randomly placed in the exam (paper and pencil and computer-based forms). These pilot questions are included to judge their effectiveness for use on future exams, but they will NOT be used in the scoring of this exam. All other questions will be considered in the scoring. All unanswered questions are scored incorrect. Therefore, candidates should answer every question on the exam. There is no set requirement for the distribution of correct answers for the multiple-choice preliminary examinations. It is possible that a particular answer choice could appear many times on an examination or not at all. Candidates are advised to answer each question to the best of their ability, independently from how they have answered other questions on the examination.
>
> Since the CBT exam will be offered over a period of a few days, each candidate will receive a test form composed of questions selected from a pool of questions. Statistical scaling methods are used to ensure within reasonable and practical limits that, during the same testing period of a few days, all forms of the test are comparable in content and passing criteria. The methodology that has been adopted is used by many credentialing programs that give multiple forms of an exam.
>
> The ranges of weights shown in the Learning Objectives below are intended to apply to the large majority of exams administered. On occasion, the weights of topics on an individual exam may fall outside the published range. Candidates should also recognize that some questions may cover multiple learning objectives.

### **2.1 Scoring Table**

All exams are scored based on your *Actual Score* `A` and the *Passing Score* `P` for that paper:

| Grade | Actual to Passing Ratio |
|:-:|:-:|
| $0$ | $0 < A ≤ 0.5P$ |
| $1$ | $0.5 < A ≤ 0.6P$ |
| $2$ | $0.6P < A ≤ 0.7P$ |
| $3$ | $0.7P < A ≤0.8P$ |
| $4$ | $0.8P < A ≤ 0.9P$ |
| $5$ | $0.9P < A ≤ P$ |
| $6$ | $P ≤ A < 1.1P$ |
| $7$ | $1.1P ≤ A < 1.2P$ |
| $8$ | $1.2P ≤ A ≤ 1.3P$ |
| $9$ | $1.3P ≤ A < 1.4P$ |
| $10$ | $1.4P ≤ A < Maximum$ |

Thus, candidates are NOT scored against another student - it is NOT a zero-sum game!

### **2.2 Study Material**

For each exam, SOA/CAS lists the textbooks or source material from which they use to create the questions. They also provide a list of sample questions or previous papers to practice.

There are many companies who create their own study manuals or guides that *summarize* and organize the content in a logical and easy to understand fashion for studying. They also compile previous questions to create practice sets or quizzes to help drill in concepts at various checkpoints while studying.

There are several popular ones:

* Coaching Actuaries (SOA)
* The Infinite Actuary (SOA/CAS)
* PAK Study Manual (SOA/CAS)
* ACTEX Study Manual (SOA/CAS)

For preliminary exams, most people would recommend using these study guides to help familiarize with the material. However, for later exams, it is generally recommended to go through the textbook or source material directly as it is necessary to have a *deep understanding* of the content as obscure topics (that are often omitted in study material) are typically tested to catch candidates off guard.

### **Examination Strategies**

#### **Planning**

Always plan ahead in what *order* to clear the examinations and which sittings are optimal to fulfil that order. Having a rough timeline in mind allows you to plan other life or work events around it way ahead of time, preventing you from being too overloaded at any one point.

It is recommended to only take **one examination at a time** - it may result in a longer pathway but it is better to guarantee passing one exam rather than to risk failing two! However, as some higher level examinations are only offered once or twice a year, it may be more efficient to take two papers together. Ultimately, it boils down to your risk preference.

Most importantly, always **plan for breaks or downtime** between each exam. Due to the increasing difficulty between exams, it is very common to feel burnt out - so always make sure there is some planned enjoyment to reset after a paper!

Later examinations do not have instant results. As such, it is recommended to **clear modules** during the ~2 month waiting time. If all the modules are done, then the time is better used to rest!

#### **Suggested Timeline**

It is recommended to only start studying about **~4 months before each sitting**. Studying too early may result in burn out before the sitting, which may affect your ability to pass.

The top priority is to always sweep through all the content to gain a high level understanding of it. After that, you should be exposed to as many practice questions as possible to refine our understanding of the content.

> It is recommended to create your own set of notes or a cheatsheet with key formulas and refer to it while practicing. This may allow you to tap into your photographic memory and picture the formulas in your head!

Weeks before the paper, it is advised to take mock examinations without referring to notes and with a time limit in order to simulate and adapt to exam conditions. In the days leading up to the paper, focus should be on completing short quizzes and re-attempting questions that were done incorrectly.

The day before and hours leading up to the paper is the most important. The most important thing is to be in the right mental and emotional state to walk into the examination room **as confident as possible** - thus, no new questions should be attempted, just reviewing past mistakes and going over key concepts & formulas.

The golden rule of studying is that **studying a small amount everyday is much better than studying a large amount just one day** - consistency is key.

#### **Shortcuts**

Most exam problems can be solved via **First Principles**, which has the advantage of only needing to know a few formulas.

However, the issue is that some problems can become extremely long winded, requiring a disproportionate amount of time to solve via first principles. Thus, it is advisable to memorize certain shortcuts for tedious methods to save precious time during the exam.

#### **During the examination**

Always sweep through the paper once, skipping any difficult or long winded questions. Only after the first pass is done, then return to these skipped questions. Once all is done, perform a sense check on our methods and answers to ensure we did not make a careless mistake.

The reason is to "secure" questions that we know we can do, rather than spending time on questions we may not get right and risk not having enough time for questions we know. Similarly, some of these tougher questions could be *pilot questions*, which may not even count towards our grade anyway.

Although time consuming, it is recommended to write out as much working as possible with all the parameters to reduce the chances of making an error. It also eases the checking process as we have something to work with.

#### **Multiple Choice Questions**

Do not fall into the trap of thinking that once one of the options is obtained that it should be the correct answer. Most questions have options that will be obtained if a wrong input or formula is used.

For word based options, there are always a few options that are extremely similar to one another, with only one or two words that are different - choose the right ones!

Always leave some time to check that the correct options have been selected. Do not throw away marks for carelessness. Along similar lines, never leave options as the option number on our working - always leave the exact value or phrase. This helps us to easily catch instances where we clicked the wrong option.

#### **Written Answer Questions**

Do not fall into the trap of thinking that longer and more detailed answers are better. These type of answers tend to be viewed as beating around the bush and thus may not be awarded the point.

Each society typically has some guidelines on how to approach written answer questions with respect to what type of answer to give and how long the answer should be.

### **2.4 Technical Difficulties**

In the event that there are any technical issues with the computer, DO NOT try to resolve it yourself. Immediately contact the test centre staff to help you. Ensure that they **STOP the examination timer** as soon as possible as you do not want to lose precious exam time.

In the event that the issue cannot be resolved on site immediately, ensure that the test centre provides a retake **WITHIN THE SAME TESTING WINDOW**. This is to ensure that all the effort put into studying is not wasted; so that you do not have to study another 4-6 months for the next sitting.

DO NOT leave the test centre until this is confirmed - this will put pressure on them to resolve the situation properly. Always ask for names and numbers of staff members to be able to get confirmation or direct follow up on your case.

## **3. Company Support**

Most insurance companies have an **Actuarial Study Program** in place to support their actuaries in the credentialling process.

The program ususally contains the following benefits:

1. **Reimbursement** for the cost of the examination and related study material
2. **Extra days off** to study and take examinations
3. **Salary increments** for completing an examination

However, these benefits usually come with some conditions as well:

* Reimbursement only for the first 2 attempts on the same exam
* Days off decreases with each failed attempt
* Bonded for a short duration (~3-6 months) after making use of any benefit
* Companies will only support exams from a specific society or tracks (EG. GI companies CAS, Life companies ILA FSA track)

### **Salary Increments**

When finding a job, your salary is calculated in one of two ways:

1. Base Pay (Negotiable) + Examination Increment per the company's study policy
2. Package deal containing both (Negotiable)

Entry level positions typically use `option 1` while higher level positions use `option 2`. There is no standard market practice for this.

### **Employer Society Relationship**

These actuarial societies are not regulated by any official government body. Thus, there is *no minimum pass rate* that they must provide. However, they are in some sense “regulated” by Actuarial employers.

This works the same was as how any business has to *listen to its customers* for feedback. The customers provide revenue for the business - if they feel that their needs are not being met, they would no longer patronise the business.

Actuarial employers are the main ones who pay for these exams. Thus, the society has to set the pass rate such that they meet the needs of employers:

1. **Pass rates too low** - Too few credentialed actuaries; talent supply is limited
2. **Pass rate too high** - Too many credentialed actuaries; hard to tell the competent from incompetent
3. **Irrelevant content** - Knowledge acquired through exams is not relevant to the job

Actuarial societies can charge stupid amounts of money for each exam because they know that employers are paying for it no matter what. However, if the employers feel that the credential no longer holds its weight, they will no longer pay for it and the society will lose money.

## **Other considerations**

### Purpose of the Examinations

<!--
Most companies would prefer to hire credentialed Actuaries anyway, thus focusing on examinations tends to result in both

Are these examinations really necessary to be an Actuary?
	· Insurance is an extremely risky businesses - much more so than banks which operate similarly
	· Actuaries are in charge of making decisions that affects a HUGE amount of capital
	· Going through a rigorous credentialling process provides confidence to both the company and regulators that any decision made can be trusted
		○ The rigorous process prepares Actuaries for problem solving & statistical thinking
		○ Showing that they have a great deal of intellect, discipline and focus
	· From a theoretical perspective,
		○ Preliminary examinations, while not directly related, provide the foundational knowledge to understand higher level examinations 
		○ Concepts learnt in higher level examinations may not be directly used as they are already incorporated into the many Actuarial tools and software
		○ But it is important for us to understand what those tools are doing to be able to interpret their output
	· From a practical perspective,
		○ The rigorous examination process creates a higher barrier to entry, limiting the supply of Actuaries which helps to keep wages consistently above average
			§ This is why most people are against the SOA/CAS watering down the examination process - it lowers the barrier to entry
		○ Additionally, it provides a high degree of control over one’s career progression
			§ Choosing between taking more examinations to get credentialed or contributing more at work to get promoted  
			§ Most believe that the examinations are guaranteed and last forever thus should always be prioritised over work

		keeps the bozos out

What are some additional qualifications to consider?
	· The general consensus is that to be a good actuary, only a fellowship is required
	· Taking other professional qualifications (EG. CFA) will NOT value add to an Actuarial career
	· These additional qualifications should only be taken if one is thinking of moving to higher management or to switch industries - both of which entail leaving the Actuarial career
		○ If one did not take the Corporate Finance FSA track or equivalent, then these additional qualifications could be used to gain knowledge about general business concepts
		○ Outside of Insurance, the Actuarial designation is not well recognised. Thus, getting these additional qualifications can help to create opportunities for a change in jobs
	· Another possible reason is that there are growing trends in the industry (EG. Coding & Data Science) - these additional qualifications provide a method for Actuaries to keep up to date with these skills
	· Despite all this, most Actuaries will often not pursue them as they have already spent a large portion of their lives studying for the fellowship examinations - they would not want to study again for very marginal benefits!

All companies support the exam process (registration, books etc)
but the most importna thing is whether orn not they encourage it or honor it
Some parts of the year where clients take precendent over exams etc means they wont honorit

Intent was to force people down the SOA route and choke out the CAS - previously was 5 shared exams, now only 2

Countercyclical > Demand for actuaries go up in recesses due to the increased amount of regulatory work or analysis required

Compared to comp science, everything will of course be low paying
With any corporate job, the key to making big money is moving up into management > Actuaries are very well suited to do that

Once hit a certain point though, it will stagnate until upper management

Consulting always seems like there are more jobs as there is higher turnover

That we aren’t actually as smart as other people think we are. People tend to think we’re really good at math, when in reality we are just good test takers and a lot of modern tools lets us easily prepare for the exams. Gone are the days where the actuary was someone in the back room who could calculate your premium on the back of a napkin.

Brings questions to their supervisors after an appropriate amount of independent effort. I’ve worked with analysts that either spend too much time trying to figure it out on their own and end up wasting time, or give up too easily without trying and say “I don’t know what to do, fix my problem for me.” The good analysts first put in their own effort, but don’t waste time, and come to their supervisors with good questions.

Communication, technical accuracy, curiosity, eager to learn, good documentation.

If you have questions on a new task, accumulate your questions to ask all at once instead of sending a question every 15 minutes. Know the difference of when to ask by IM versus email.

Communicate progress on tasks periodically before being asked.

If you are updating previous work, take the time to really understand it. Make updates to leave it better than you found it. Make it easier to update or improve documentation.

Make sure your updates function as expected. You wouldn't believe the number of times I have asked an analyst to make a VBA macro for me, and then it doesn't work when they send it to me.

Take time to think if your results are reasonable. Knowing what is reasonable is tough when you are starting out. Look at previous results to see if these results are similar. I would much rather have an analyst over flag issues than under flag. It is a teaching opportunity for the analyst, and that way any real problems are found earlier than later.

Make a reconciliation to show that your results include all relevant data. For example, if you have X dollars of raw claims you started with, show you have X dollars in your data drop, and exhibit too.
