# **Life Products**

This section is meant to provide an **overview of the key features** of the different types of life insurance policies and their common variations.

## **Product Type**

There are several types of insurance that fall under the "Life" category. All of them insure against **risks associated with the human life**.

This section will focus on the **key ideas** behind each type of product. It is NOT meant to cover the specific mechanics of how each product functions.

Note that not all of the product types mentioned below are offered as a standalone product. Some are often **combined with regular life insurance** or offered as an **optional rider** to a regular life insurance plan. 

### **Life Insurance**

Life Insurance is a contract whereby the insurer will pay out a benefit to the **beneficiary** if the policyholder **dies** or becomes diagnosed with **Terminal Illness**.

Individuals who **die earlier than expected** leave their dependents (who have yet to become financially independent) without financial support. Thus, life insurance helps to provide:

* **Income Replacement**: Replaces the income that would have been earned by the insured; allowing their dependents to maintain their current lifestyle
* **Debt Repayment**: Covers outstanding debts of the family (EG. Home Mortgage)

There are also **expenses associated with death** (EG. Hospice, Funeral). The benefit payout can also be used to **cover these expenses**, ensuring that **no financial burden** was left onto their family.

### **Total Permanent Disability**

Total Permanent Disability (TPD) insurance is a contract whereby the insurer will pay a benefit to the insured in the event that they become **totally and permanently disabled**.

Most insurers use the some variation of the below definition for TPD:

* The **inability** to engage in *any* paid work
* **Irrecoverable** physical loss - loss of sight in both eyes, loss of two limbs or a loss of sight in one eye and loss of one limb

Individuals who have TPD can **no longer work**. Thus, TPD insurance similarly provides **Income replacement** and **Debt Repayment** coverage for the beneficiaries of the insured.

They also incur **additional expenses** that can be covered with the benefit pay out:

* **Medical Expenses**: Healthcare costs not covered by Health Insurance (Due to nature of treatment or coverage limit)
* **Non-Medical Expenses**: Cost of home modifications or assistive devices to aid living with TPD (EG. Wheelchair ramps or Communication aids)

Since the benefit can be used to cover necessary expenses, it ensures that **no financial burden** falls upon the family of the insured. Additionally, it also **preserves their own financial resources**, allowing them to be used for their intended purposes (EG. Retirement or Children's Education).

!!! Note

	The above point can be made for all remaining products types that trigger a payout while the insured is still alive.



There are three states that a policy can be in:

* **In-Force** - Required premiums have been **paid** and will remain active **till the next premium due date**
* **Lapsed** - Required premiums **have NOT been paid** and will become inactive from then on
* **Paid Up** - **ALL** required premiums **have been paid** and will remain **active for the remaining duration of the policy**

!!! Info

    There is usually a **grace period** of about 1 month for the insured to make the required premium payment **after the premium due date**.

    Most insurers allow a lapsed policy to be **Reinstated** within a **specified window** after it has lapsed. It typically involves paying the **outstanding premiums** since lapse.

    However, reinstatement is **not guaranteed**. Some insurers may require the individual to go through **medical underwriting** again. In such cases, the terms of the policy may be adjusted if the insured's condition has worsened.

### **Regular Premium (RP)**

A **Regular Premium** policy must have premiums paid at **regular intervals** for the policy to remain in-force.

From an

Regardless which choice is chosen, the total premiums required are the **same from an actuarial perspective**. Thus, regular premiums tend to have the **smallest magnitude**.

This option is suited for individuals who have a **steady stream of income** and are thus able to **spread the cost** of insurance over an extended period of time.

### **Single Premium (SP)**

A **Single Premium** policy only needs to have premium paid **once** on inception. The policy becomes **paid up** from that point on.

Naturally, single premiums would have the **largest magnitude** as the entire premium is being paid upfront.

This option is suited for individuals with a **large amount of liquid assets** (typically obtained via a windfall) and are thus able to **secure the insurance coverage** in a single payment.

### **Limited Pay (LP)**

A **Limited Pay** policy is a mixture of the above:

* Premiums must be paid at **regular intervals for a fixed period**; premiums must be paid for the policy to remain in-force during this period
* After that period, the policy is **paid up from that point on**
* Premium size tends to be **significantly larger** than regular premiums

The required period could be defined in two ways:

1. **Explicit** - Payments required for a **fixed number of years** (EG. 20 years) 
2. **Implicit** - Payments required **till a certain age** (EG. Till age 65)

This option is suited for individuals who either:

* Have **unreliable** streams of income; cannot afford to spread the cost
* Have **high income**; can afford to pay the higher premiums

### **Premium Mode**

The **frequency** at which premiums are paid is known as the **Premium Mode**. For most policies, premiums are to be **paid annually** by default.

However, most insurers offer the option to pay premiums on a **more frequent basis** instead to suit individuals with different needs - **Semi-Annually**, **Quarterly** or **Monthly**.

Generally speaking, premiums **paid more frequently have a slightly higher magnitude** when compared on the same basis:


This is due to reflect the **higher cost** to accomodate more frequent payments:

* **Opportunity cost of interest** due to premiums being received later
* **Higher expenses** due to increased billing and processing

!!! Warning

    A common misconception is that paying a higher premium would contribute more to the cash value of the policy.

    The additional costs are entirely to reflect higher costs; **insurers are typically indifferent** between payment modes as the amount going to the insurance portion remains the same.
