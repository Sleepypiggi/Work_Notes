Life insurance not for you for loved ones
Add maintain current lifestyle

Insurance is about pooling
If too easy to claim, the cost of the pool will rise and rates will increase
EG. AIA too easy to claim, rates likely to be higher
If you are meant to claim you will be able to claim, only those trying to push for more etc will have trouble

It depends. Many people donâ€™t consider the opportunity cost of investing the remaining sum of money if you pay monthly premium.

Given your annualised monthly premium is 2% more than annual payment, you need at least 4.6% p.a. interest to earn positive cashflow if you pay monthly.

Why 4.6% which is much higher than 2%? Because not the full sum will be earning the interest rate and principle decreases with each monthly premium payment.
