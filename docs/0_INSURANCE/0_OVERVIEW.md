Life insurance not for you for loved ones
Add maintain current lifestyle

Insurance is about pooling
If too easy to claim, the cost of the pool will rise and rates will increase
EG. AIA too easy to claim, rates likely to be higher
If you are meant to claim you will be able to claim, only those trying to push for more etc will have trouble
