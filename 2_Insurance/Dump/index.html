<p>irstly, class rating may be chal-
lenged because of its over-inclusiveness: it leads
to apply an unjustified rate to many members of
a given class.</p>
<p>Because underwriting is about discriminating
individuals for the sake of efficiency, it may
contravene antidiscrimination legislation, espe-
cially when the classification matches with the
membership to historically disadvantaged groups
(in terms of opportunities, resources, welfare,
etc.) in order to impose differentiated premiums
to the members of such groups, higher than those
paid by the members of other, more historically
advantaged, groups.</p>
<p>Underwriting
practices,
which
address
adverse selection, may be seen as discriminatory
or unjust</p>
<p>while trying to guarantee or to maximize effi-
ciency, insurers create situations that contravene
moral intuitions about justice and fairness.</p>
<p>To answer your question, insurance companies will invest the pool of money they recieve from premium payments into what are known as Mutual Funds, which are investment funds aimed at reaching a fixed or benchmark rate of return, with this rate of return structured so as to compensate the insurance company for the risk from the policies they issue that cant be removed through diversification of their portfolio.</p>
<p>Then why not extend this segmentation by classifying people according to family history of disease or genetics, for instance? Because, currently, it is not easy to segment the population in this way, and there may not be a large enough difference in mortality rates to justify the expense of segmentation. There will also certainly be political and social resistance to this degree of segmentation, since it will be viewed as an invasion of privacy and discrimination. Of course, basing life insurance premiums on sex and smoking status can also be viewed as discriminatory, but it has a sound actuarial basis. However, sex and smoking status, unlike family history or genetics, are easily observable traits, and, thus, cannot be considered an invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as technology advances, segmentation based on genetics will be attempted. While many view it as discriminatory, others will argue, and rightly so, that to not allow it would force others to subsidize the premiums of others. Since insurance rates are determined by the death rate of the insured, including people with a higher death rate at the same premium would make the premium higher for all. As with the different rates for sex and smoking status, companies will offer better rates to those willing to show their good genetic profiles, which, in turn, will cause adverse selection for the other companies not using genetics, forcing them either to raise their premiums for all or to start using genetic profiles as well.</p>
<p>Insurance Trends
Insuretech
•   It refers to technology that are meant to make the insurance industry more efficient
•   Tech company that connects to the insurance world, not the other way round
•   According to OW, there are three types of insuretech to varying degrees (Seen below)
•   Insuretech represents innovation in the industry – which is commonly thrown around as a buzzword
•   Should companies rush towards insuretech? The answer is simple – only if it is profitable to do so, not just for the sake of getting new technology</p>
<p>Distribution Based Insuretech
•   Most people are consumers of Insurance. Thus, the most common forms of Insuretech they would see are Distribution based – Lemonade, Hippo Insurance etc.
•   Taking Lemonade as an example, they use technology to help underwrite products without the need for an intermediary or underwriter, saving on these costs (~25%)
o   But are they truly making money? 
o   Depending on how they choose to treat R&amp;D (One-time expense VS Amortize) the numbers could look very different – hard to offset large R&amp;D costs
o   It is reported that even till today these companies are still making losses
•   Will these distribution based insuretech take over? While some consumers are glad to be able to save costs by going direct, others (especially less knowledgeable ones) prefer to have an expert explain it to them and help them plan rather than taking time off their already busy lives to stress about it
•   In the most extreme case, it is predicted that we will no longer have any intermediaries in the future – Given your data, AI will assess your background and prompt you to increase your coverage etc
o   In terms of Life insurance, given that there are no more commissions, this will encourage policyholders to buy additional savings
o   However, the problem with this is about getting the data into the system as well as regulatory concerns – still need an FA for investment products, Data laws etc</p>
<p>Big Data/Machine Learning
•   As technology becomes advanced and integrated into our lives, companies will have much more data to work with to determine how to price us, especially with newer cutting-edge machine learning techniques
•   At the centre of it all is the use Telematics – technology that can be used to directly collect data. Currently, it mainly refers to Car Telematics, but other similar devices already exist such as the Apple Watch or other lifestyle tracking devices
•   These telematic devices will be used to collect more precise data which can then be used to properly rate the policy. Some ethical concerns have been raised about whether insurers have the right to these data – but studies have shown that most consumers do not mind giving up this data if it can lead to lower premiums
•   However, pricing premiums too accurately could threaten the risk pool. Regulators may step in, but it will definitely be some time before that happens as legislation always lags behind technological development
•   An alternative way we can see this happening is when Insurance begins to move in-house – EG. Tesla &amp; Shopee. These companies will know more about the risk than a third-party insurer, thus they can more accurately price premiums, allowing them to be more competitive than traditional insurers</p>
<p>Rise of Specialty Insurance
•   A smaller trend would be the development of new kinds of products – Pet Insurance, Drone Insurance &amp; Cyber insurance to name a few
•   We should expect even more products to match changes in societal norms over time
SNACK by income &gt; Micro insurance to build up insurance covderage in small amounts and offer rebates from spending In the form insurance coverage
Tribe by Income &gt; Netflix subscription style insurance
Singlife Digital ILP &gt; Monitor and track ILP performance
Prudential PULSE &gt; Provides access to healthcare services, telemedicine
SGfindex &gt; Could include insurance coverage as well</p>
<p>Insurance Market in Singapore
Life Insurance VS General Insurance Size
•   Life Insurance market is larger than General in Singapore. This is the opposite of larger nations like the US, where the General Insurance sector is (slightly) larger
•   Naturally, this means that there is a greater demand for GI actuaries in other countries
•   Larger number of policyholders means that they have more data/experience to use for more complex statistical methods (Machine Learning), warranting higher pay there
•   Thus, the advice is to stick to Life Insurance if you want to stay in SG or do GI if you want the opportunity to work overseas in the future</p>
<p>Why Life is bigger in Singapore?
•   Seems a bit counter-intuitive at first because the number of Lives is limited while Cars/Corporations are not – but do they really outnumber people? (Nope)
•   Another reason could be due to the Saving/Investment component of Life Insurance – there is no limit to the amount you can choose to put into it. Coupled with the Asian mindset, this leads to larger premiums for Life
o   The Asian mindset may push them to prefer products where they can at least take access some cash value at any time – “tangible”
o   Additionally, they may also prefer the ability to pass on some wealth to the next generation or relieve their burden (Opposite of Western)</p>
<p>Why Life is smaller in other countries?
•   Other countries naturally have a larger population size – more things to insure, making General Insurance naturally much larger
•   Another aspect to consider is the regulation surrounding Life Insurance – the Savings/Investment aspect of policies there might be structured differently which may push people to invest on their own or in their pension rather than Life Insurance</p>
<p>Life Insurance Landscape
   SG has a small but developed population – most would already own a Life Insurance from one of the major players (Purchased themselves or via parents)
o   However, the Protection Gap in SG is much larger than expected
   The gameplan for Life Insurance in SG is not to sell as many policies as possible (Not realistic due to limited population) but rather to target up-market with wealth accumulation style policies
o   This is why smaller &amp; more specialized insurers have continued to exist as they serve expats or other High Net Worth (HNW) clients
o   Suspected that they could be a front for money laundering as well!
   Mainstream companies (Pru, GE, AIA etc) are also beginning to do this with an increasing focus on Investment products etc</p>
<p>Mergers and Acquisitions in SG 
•   2010: Prudential acquired UOB Life 
•   2018: Singlife acquired Zurich Life 
•   2020: Singlife acquired Aviva 
•   2021: HSBC acquired AXA </p>
<p>Singapore in the Region
•   The biggest competitor to Singapore is Hong Kong – All financial institutions want to be in Hong Kong to tap into the large Chinese market
•   However, HK is still a part of China – Chinese investors may want to move their investments outside of China completely and will choose Singapore
•   Singapore is also a central hub to other HNW individuals within the ASEAN region, which is why we will always remain relevan</p>
