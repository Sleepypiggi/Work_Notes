<p>I’d stay with current employer if the only reason you’re looking for a new employer is because of money. Every company is disloyal. Truth is, you’re just a pawn in their game and you did what you had to do to increase your salary.</p>
<p>You’d know your situation better than anybody, but accepting a counter offer is a bad idea in my book. Whatever core issues there are that are causing you to look elsewhere aren’t going to change. Even if it’s just a salary issue, just because you get a bump now doesn’t mean that you aren’t going to be in the same place in a couple years. All employers have expected salary bands per level and if they give you a bump to not leave, it just means your future merit raises will be lower so they can fit you in your band.</p>
<p>Edit: I should add that just because you are offered a counter, it doesn’t necessarily mean they want to keep you, but rather they don’t want to spend the resources to hire/train a replacement. The difference is subtle, but it’s there.</p>
<p>Always check your work
Seen as reliable
Attempt to troubleshoot &gt; Why does this look off, how do i fix this
Curiosity, technical excellence and commuinications kills</p>
<p>Get the basics right: SHow up on time, take intensive notes, treat people like people &gt; Say hi, ask if everyone had lunch already etc, ask questions when not sure, show strong owenership in everything you do, even when ordering lunch etc. People will notice</p>
<p>Stay out of politics &gt; Leave this for your bosses to handle</p>
<p>Go to office when your boss is around &gt; Humand are social creatures &gt; Always talk to the random person on the desk vs zoom call
Annual body clock &gt; Set a month in the middle of the year where you will take long holiday or every friday off, same thing for december
Not possible to be high performing the whole year, need some days to lull periods to tell your body to recharge</p>
<p>Put facetime with seniors u want to emutlate &gt; Understand what ppl above u think
Not necessarily ur direct manager, might be someone else u worked with who u feels understand waht is going on</p>
<p>Take ownership of ur career &gt; U got like 40 years to work &gt; U want to promote fast? Ask how to do it
Dont sleep at home or on the weekends &gt; go for a walk, get coffee, dont waste ur free time </p>
<p>Always ask for someone to send a request via email to keep track of thigns
Say u are slightly tied up now, drop an email then u will look into it after
Dont overpromise, give yourself buffer
If they ask why need so long, say account for testing, adhoc support and possible revisions
Always ask for help if lost, but if someone taught u soemthing, make sure u dont have to reask</p>
<p>If feeling unwell, take mc</p>

Manager not incentive to take risk
Bosses are paid to clear block</p>
<p>Prime time for work bullies is when you are starting a new job
You will not be as agood as your colleagues, so bullies will take this time to prey on you and your confidence
1. Do not apologise. Instead say, “oh so this is how its done, no one told me this, thanks. Is there anything else I should keep in mind?
2. Ask questions from the start, be vocal. Do not let people think they can shut you up</p>
<p>Look out for month 3
During first 2 months we usually give ourselves the grace that we should accept we are slow and still learning</p>
<p>Month 3 we feel we should be settled and up to speed, but that is not usually the case</p>
<p>Most companies only involve us in manpower planning 6 months in; any work completed before that is a bonus</p>
<p>Opportunity that was needed in the insurance industry and you had to pay the bills</p>

<p>Jump = 20%

<p>Budget and headcount</p>
<p>Always elevate the errors, it normalizes the process of learning from mistakes and that you are doing the right thing
Due diligence is good, if managers punish you for elevating errors and requesting for help to review, then you should look for another employer</p>
<p>People Management
•   If someone is under you, you are responsible for everything they do &amp; hence you should always review their work
o   When reviewing work, always praise openly but criticise privately. If they already know they made a mistake, do not dwell on it – it does not do anybody any good
•   Junior people are often afraid to ask questions – this leaves them to struggle indefinitely on a task. A good way to overcome this is to reduce friction behind asking questions:
o   Actively encouraging them to ask questions
o   Being responsive on your company’s messaging platform
o   Scheduling follow-up meetings not long after assigning a task
•   When assigning tasks, always try to explain the rationale behind them (Big Picture), even if they don’t necessarily need to know it to complete it. If possible, try to break it down into smaller pieces to help them connect everything together
•   DO NOT outright do things for them, even if it seems trivial to you. In the long run, it is much better for them to do it themselves and learn</p>
<p>There's no easy way around it. Learn the reason why something is done. Connect what you do to regulations, standards, guidance, internal policies, etc. You may even need to crack open an old textbook.</p>
<p>Gain practical hnds on experience which will help you determine if this is something you would like to pursue as a career
HR are the least inclined people to take hiring risks
They are not going to take risks hiring a hidden talent
Email people direct to fast track interviews
HR will always send you paper qualified but otherwise meh new hires
Industry is small, people move around &gt; Important to network, make connections
Promotion is about seeing whether u exhibit qualities of the upper tier</p>
<p>Sometimes max exodus at certain companies, need help</p>
<p>People leave all the time, movement is high</p>
<p>Problems only grow bigger but team</p>
<p>That's totally not the right mindset dude. Clarification beforehand is much better than assumption.</p>
<p>Interview with VPs are probably more about big picture things and less about day to day.</p>
<p>You can do some research on the VP and ask specific questions about his background. Ask about career growth, his vision on the teams you’ll be working for. Actuarial program, etc.</p>
<p>(A) study. This should be the answer until you get your ASA.</p>
<p>(B) be proactive and ask your boss for more work. Only issue here is that once you enter busy time, your workload might be too much. Also, you then become expected to handle alot more tasks while on your current salary.</p>
<p>(C) ask peer if they need any immediate help. I like this more than B because it typically just gives you non-longterm work and also helps build rapport with your coworkers.</p>
<p>(D) go back and refine projects that you work on on a monthly/quarterly basis. Make code more efficient, build neater excel sheets, write documentation. I think this is the best since it shows you can take initiative on your own and also because it will make your job easier in the long run. Then when you become more senior, you transfer the tasks to others easily and get manager/teaching skills.</p>
<p>(E) work on a side hustle. Wont advance you as far at work but can increase you income pretty easily. My side hustle was my house. I recently sold it and the tax-free profit from selling (200k) was more than the salary I earned for the 3-4 years I owned the place.</p>
<p>(F) learn new skills that could earn you a higher paying tech job.</p>
<p>It is highly advised to <strong>focus on examinations early on in your career</strong> while still relatively junior as you have fewer responsibilities. Once promoted to senior or management, it will be significantly harder to find time to study due to the increased responsibility and stress.</p>
<p>There is also less incentive to study at higher levels as you would be earning much more - the few hundred dollars increment is insignificant at that point.</p>
<p>Hard for people to trust you with big things if you make small mistakes
Can’t take all projects, need to choose between projects</p>

<p>Did you like the people you interviewed with? I ask this because if you have a dick manager, it'll be quite tough on a small team. Also, in a small team first impressions last. If your performance is not up to their expectations, it will spread throughout the team within a day. Lastly be careful what you say to people.

Tighter salary distribution and sufficiently high salary floor (post-credentials) that money shouldn’t be an issue in life. Definitely didn’t love the grind but the variability in DS/CS salaries is enough to make your head spin.</p>
<p>"", [1/11/2022 8:00 AM]
No one has ever asked me this, but my main reasoning is that jobs in DS/CS seemed very oversaturated at the entry level, and while the actuarial field is also like this I believed it to be less so based on the barrier that the exams create as well as being generally less popular. I'm not sure if this is/was true but it did impact my decision. Also, I'm under the impression that CS/DS has a much more unclear career progression, so while it's true that you can make a lot of money, getting those jobs seems to be a large function of networking and right place at the right time, which felt uncomfortably uncertain to me. And again, I know this exists to a large degree in the actuarial field also, but at least there is a clear progression I can follow to have a good chance of getting a good job in the future.</p>
<p>Also, I consider myself a good test taker and don't really mind the exam process especially if the alternative is grad school. So for me it is a fair price to pay for better job prospects and more certainty of success.</p>
<p>"", [1/11/2022 8:00 AM]
There’s always a better job/career. Doesn’t mean this one is bad.</p>
<p>And they've got a point because that's probably the most natural way we learn things.</p>
<p>Schooling in general tends to have it backwards: a teacher visits a series of subjects that the students learn contextlessly to then tackle problems they were never primed for. And I think the course creators ape this for lack of a better front-of-mind template.</p>
<p>But that's almost never how things work in the real world, in which you tend to get a problem + context first, which then requires some creativity and learning to figure out and solve. Hence why academic performance can feel more like theater than actually being predictive of real world productivity.</p>
<p>So for an example of "normal" or okay teaching in other media, decent video game tutorials don't just infodump their mechanics to new players like schools and courses do -- that would be boring, right? Instead they show some of the problems necessitating them upfront before giving the player the tools to solve them, like a gap that cannot be crossed without using a double jump or glide item (with a reward you can see on the other side that you want to come back to later ofc), or an enemy that needs to be treated differently to be damaged using a new ability. It's so common as to be a design trope in video games ... now why might that be?</p>

<p>Introduction to Actuarial Functions
Types of Companies Actuaries can work in
Direct/Primary Insurance Carriers
•   Like most other firms, actuaries in direct carriers work in specific departments according to their line of work (Pricing, Reserving/Valuation, Reporting etc)
o   Each department typically has their own quirks which will be explored later, but there are still several unique aspects about working in a direct company
•   The work given is typically routine – updating and maintaining rather than reinventing the wheel
o   This gets boring over time but also means that the work is not very stressful other than a few pre-determined peak periods which makes it easier to plan ahead and study for exams
o   Repeatedly working on the same task also means that you specialise in that particular field, which allows you to gain a depth of understanding in that area, but that area only (Unless you rotate departments or move jobs)
•   If a new project is available, the considerations that go into it are very different – rather than just focusing on the solution, need to consider Legacy Problems, Efficiency etc</p>
<p>Small Insurers
New Insurer Branch Insurer
Company wanting to enter into the Insurance business (EG. Tesla, Shoppee)   Small regional outlet in SG for a large overseas insurer (EG. Swiss Life)
Typically has a small actuarial team to help build up the business and hopefully expand Typically has no actuarial team at all as most of the work is done overseas
No one else in the company would know what you are doing thus nobody can screw you, but that also means that if shit hits the fan nobody else can help you either   Not enough work here to justify hiring a full team thus most of the work that needs to be done is outsourced to consulting</p>
<p>Reinsurance Carriers
•   Work in a reinsurance company is very different – Rather than having individual policy data, you get a bird’s eye view with aggregated portfolio level data
•   Data comes from different lines of business or different companies each with their own way of formatting it
o   Thus, they will also need interns or EL hires to clean the data and perform other menial tasks for them, much more so than primary/direct insurers
•   Working with a small amount of useful data means that an Actuary’s knowledge and ability to deal with ambiguity is extremely important. This means that the work is very high level &amp; complex – it is recommended to go into the field much later on when you are experienced and have much stronger understanding of Insurance Risk
•   It is not recommended to enter as EL and hope to climb as an incoming outsider with more diverse experience will be valued more</p>
<p>Consulting can’t teach you cos they dk even know what’s going on since each project is new
Consulting Firms
•   Consulting firms perform project-based work for Direct Companies:
o   Audits → Double checking the insurer’s calculations 
o   Advisory → One off projects for Insurer’s who do not have the manpower or expertise to perform a certain task (EG. Small insurer, IFRS17)
•   Instead of working in a fixed department, Consultants typically work on multiple different projects, each with a different set of teammates
•   Working in consulting exposes you to a wide range of different functions within the industry as opposed to just one. Through working with different clients, you also get to a bird’s eye view of the industry by understanding how &amp; why their methods differ
o   This makes Consulting a rather appealing place to start early on in your career as it allows you to gain experience much faster which would have otherwise taken you 10 years of working and moving around
o   However, no two people’s experience will be the same. Everyone would have taken on a different set of projects and learn different things. You can’t predict with certainty exactly what you will be exposed to
•   Most of the project requires you to start from scratch or something to that effect as each project is new, rather than maintaining or updating a particular model or workflow. Teams are also a lot smaller which means that communication is much simpler
•   However, the work also tends to have tight deadlines meaning that everything is fast paced. Additionally, since the scope of the project varies, it is likely that you will need to learn a lot of things on the job as well. This makes Consulting a rather stressful choice with little work-life balance
o   This makes it harder to study for exams and get credentialed as an Actuary as you would not have the time and/or energy to do so
o   But if you have been in consulting since the start, you will be more used to the lifestyle and would be able to cope better than someone who transferred in
•   Different consulting firms tend to get different kind of projects:
o   Big 4 Accounting → Audits, Modelling
o   Actuarial Consulting → M&amp;A and other high-level stuff</p>
<p>Actuarial Roles
•   In both Life and General insurance, we can summarize actuarial work into 4 main areas:
o   Pricing → Calculates how much premium should be charged
o   Valuation/Reserving → Calculates how much capital needs to be held
o   Financial Reporting → Calculates how much should be reported as profits etc
o   Enterprise Risk Management → Maintaining the overall risk management framework for the company (Risk identification, limits, forecasts and defence etc)
•   Additional categories may be added for Life or General insurance specifically, but those functions are rather niche. Each category can also be split into more sub-categories, but this list is meant to be a broad overview</p>
<p>Valuation/Reserving
•   Valuation work tends to be routine – Monthly &amp; around key financial reporting dates
•   Outside of these weeks, the work is rather chill. This allows you to focus your time on other important aspects of your career – Exams, Upskilling &amp; Networking
•   There are two other reasons why Valuation is especially good for newcomers:
o   Valuation is the most structured function. There are pre-defined methods to calculate the reserve, allowing you to properly learn how the product works and gain a stronger overall understanding of the business
o   Reserves dictate how much free cash is available for all the other aspects of the company. As such, all key stakeholders in the company are interested in it. This provides a strong opportunity to not only further your understanding of the business, but also to network or make yourself known to key stakeholders
•   Calculating the reserves will become easier and trivial over time. A key skill to pick up in this role is understanding WHY the reserves have moved and WHAT are the implications for the company. Once you have understood it, the next step it is to be able to EXPLAIN it a non-technical fashion to other stakeholders
•   However, one of the downsides is that it gets boring over time. Once you start to grasp the above concepts, the work is simply repeating the same things repeatedly
o   Some predict that advanced techniques such as Machine Learning may be used
o   While they can be more accurate, they are also black boxes which means that they are much harder to understand &amp; explain to key stakeholders which makes it unlikely to be adopted
o   Some recommend using the downtime to help automate some of them tasks so that crunch periods are a lot more manageable</p>
<p>Pricing Roles
•   Most insurance companies have been around for years or even decades with their own pricing models – Is there still anything to do?
o   Although the models were already built, they need to be updated to better reflect experience or the current economic environment
o   If the model was built long ago, updating the model to reflect modern methods (Predictive Analytics/Machine Learning etc) can also be considered
o   If the insurer releases a new product, then a new model must be built – this will involve a lot of market research and User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
•   In general, pricing work is more flexible than Reserving/Valuation as there are no fixed deadlines (Reporting periods etc)
•   It also includes interacting with other non-financial departments (Sales, Marketing &amp; IT) to help operationalize the product etc</p>
<p>Pricing and reserving are two sides of the same coin with different functions
But the coin overall represents keeping an insurance company solvent
Reserving is all about the policies already sold and seeks to make projections about how those libailities will develop so the company can keep enough capital to cover those losses
Pricing is all about the policies that haven’t been sold. Pricing ensures that prospective policies will generate enough capital to keep the company solvent and profitable for the liabilities it is about to incur</p>
<p>Actuarial Career Advice
Internship Choices
•   In general, there are two schools of thought:
o   Explore the Industry → Aim to intern in different LOBs and Roles
o   Specialize in a line of business → Aim to intern in the same LOBs &amp; Roles
•   Internships are meant for you to gain experience in and know more about the industry. Thus, some people prefer to move around different parts of the industry to get a taste of everything to make a more informed career decision at the end
•   However, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive. Others also feel the need to specialize in a particular field so that they are favoured in the hiring process, or return to the same company to be able to easily convert to a full-time position
•   Regardless of which side of the argument you take, both can be easily countered:
o   Internships will only scratch the surface of what that line of work entails due to the limited time and skillset available. It is a decent good preliminary gauge on whether you will like that line of work, but it is by no means an accurate one
o   Specializing to get a head start is also redundant, as whatever head start you obtained through your internships will be immediately eclipsed the moment you start work
•   Thus, there is no right or wrong answer. Experience is experience – intern at whichever company offers you!</p>
<p>Internship Performance
•   As stated before, internships are meant for you to learn – no one expects you to be productive at the start
•   What they do expect is that you show progress – show that you are learning and improving in your work
•   Depending on the nature of the programme, some internships may have formal trainings while others will not – either way, how much you learn is solely up to you:
o   If you have questions are or curious, you should try to think of an answer &amp; then clarify when you cannot think of a suitable one
o   If you are given a simple task, finish it early and then explore – what was the underlying reasons it was done this way?
•   Always ask for feedback for whatever work you do – periodic feedback will help you improve throughout the internship as well</p>
<p>o If you want to convert, you should not just say but show it. If you want to take on extra load, ask for it. As an intern, you decide what you get out of it</p>
<p>Show illustrations, that’s the best way to teach or convince
Good to send updates often
Structured thinking
Test everything, understans what you want to do</p>
<p>MAP is good but rotate between teams wont learn much
Need to stay on after the bond is over for about a year to get your footing in that area then go away</p>
<p>In most companies, salary adjustments and increments are a zero sum game
Team can be performing very well around the board but managers forced to rank the team
Always tied to a budget -thus zero sum game
There are other ways to reward employees, but yearly bonus and increments are the main drivers for most employees</p>
<p>Don’t blame anyone for leaving because of salary – it is encouraged</p>
<p>New hires typically hired based on the current market rate which changes
New hires can be paid more than oldies
It is up to the managers to fight and say that the long term employees are not being properly paid, budget is a lame excuse</p>
<p>Workplace is a like never ending high school where people operate with teenage mentalities
Coworkers get angry when you turn down their offers to hang out
Boss is jealous of you because you have a healthy family lifestyle
Asking for pay means radicalized against company culture
Purposely mess up pay hours and benefits because they don’t like you</p>
<p>But remember your co workers are not your friends, don’t ever treat them as such
You don’t need to tell therm everything about yourself</p>
<p>Just because people don’t help you or are not willing to help you does not make them your enemy
Just because if someone helps you does not make them your friend
Know your co-workers motivation, why are they still here and whats in it for them</p>
<p>Don’t be too valuable that you cant be promoted &gt; Doing too much at your pay grade, too efficient and thus cant afford to promote you
Never be too good at a bad job or be good not great
There is literally no benefit to go beyond your contract</p>
<p>The best employee is a skilled employee with major financial obligations
Pay them a little above market rate and they will stay even under toxic management
Fear/golden handcuffs prevent them from leaving
Prevents most people from looking for jobs because the devil you know is better than the one you don’t</p>
<p>Life is too short to deal with a garbage manager
Change teams or companies
From managers perspective it is easier to nego pay bump if already have an offer in hand</p>
<p>Promotion years are never formal but more of a cultural thing - bring it up to people giving you feedback
When you demonstrate that you have been performing at the next level, theres a good chance you will be promoted</p>
<p>Dont bother thinking that you can be partner etc - there are many other people ahead of you, but also a lot of people leave or dont want to take that role</p>
<p>I expect to be compensated fairly for the value I bring to the company
I consider compensation as a whole,m not just base salary
The exact number depends on benefits, bonuises, stock, vacation time and other aspects</p>
<p>Don’t hide the fact that you are interviewing with other companies
Im currently in the interview process with a few opportunities
I like this companies and what this role offers but however im keeping myself open to other opportunities as well</p>
<p>There are many people who will graduate and make close to 5 figures in SWE or finance
If money is the main motive, there are definitely other places to be in
I am in this for relatively low stress and ok money
Credentials is a safety net</p>

<p>This internship was done in partnership with GIA, so we had a lot of <strong>training</strong> from both Chubb and GIA to understand how the Insurance industry works and the various stakeholders and products.</p>
<p>I was part of the Casualty team so we focused on Liability products. I <strong>shadowed an underwriter</strong> and helped him with his work where I can. I learnt about how underwriters analyze risk both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p>My main takeaway from the internship was <strong>NOT to follow the numbers blindly</strong> - pay attention to fundamental reason behind the numbers.</p>
<p>My mentor and I were working on the <strong>Grabfood account</strong>. At the time (2021), Grabfoods revenue had almost <em>quadrupled</em> - this would have warranted an increase in premiums based on the pricing model.</p>
<p>But if you think about it, their performance was so good because we were in <em>lockdown</em> during that period - everyone was ordering food delivery. It was unlikely that the following year would have this well a performance as everyone would start returning to school and office as restrictions eased.</p>
<p>If we had just followed the numbers blindly, we would have <em>overcharged</em> them and lost the business to a competitor. So we proposed to charge a <em>significantly lower</em> than the techncial premium.</p>
<p>In an Actuarial context, we are not so close to the risk - but I think the principle can still be applied. Don't just go through the motion, try to understand whats driving the numbers a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="22-ey-life-valuation"><strong>2.2 EY - Life Valuation</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#22-ey-life-valuation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This was my <em>first</em> Life Actuarial Internship - so I spent a lot of time on my own learning about the <strong>different products</strong> and features and <strong>how to calculate the liability</strong>.</p>
<p>I was working mainly on Audits and providing some minor support in other advisory projects - Pricing, ORSA and Market Research etc.</p>
<h4 id="22a-ey-key-project-manulife-audit"><strong>2.2a EY Key Project - Manulife Audit</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#22a-ey-key-project-manulife-audit" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>My main takeaway from the internship was to <strong>work independently</strong>.</p>
<p>Consulting was fast paced and everyone was working on multiple projects at once - so I learnt that <strong>time was a very precious resource</strong> - nobody had the time to guide me step by step.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is everyone's first time looking at the project so no one knows all the answers from the get go. Clients may also take awhile to respond, so it takes awhile to get answers.</p>
<p>I learnt how to look at past examples and trial &amp; error with the current information we have and come up with a <strong>hypothesis</strong> before going back to my manager or client for clarification.</p>
<p>I was working on the <strong>Manulife Audit</strong> where I was modelling a Par and ILP product. There was a lot of trouble with the ILP product because they modelled it using AXIS. They had to make a lot of weird adjustments in the way the calculated the non-unit reserve. Their documentation was also unclear or missing information, so we had a lot of trouble with it.</p>
<p>I had to reverse engineer the model based on their illustration and what we were given, completely reworking the existing template that we had. Based on what I had created, then we went back to them to double confirm the approach, rather than waiting for them to come back to us with a detailed response.</p>

<p>This was my <em>second</em> life internship, so I was trusted to take on more intermediate topics like <strong>RBC2</strong>.</p>
<p>My role on the team was to <em>conduct &amp; improve</em> the Business As Usual (BAU) tasks to generate the monthy/quarterly report to MAS so that my colleagues could focus on other pressing tasks at the time -  MAS Inspection and Stress Test.</p>
<h3 id="23a-income-key-project-bau-optimization"><strong>2.3a Income Key Project - BAU Optimization</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#23a-income-key-project-bau-optimization" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>My main takeaway from the internship was <strong>learning how an insurance company operates</strong>.</p>
<p>At EY, the tasks were one off. As such, it <em>did not matter how</em> we got it done, as long as the end product was acceptable.</p>
<p>At Income, we needed to report figures to MAS every month/quarter. Naturally, most of these processes would have been automated to some extent. However, with automation, the <em>how</em> it gets done becomes important.</p>
<p>Having been around for many years, Income has already had the necessary infrastructure to support the process - so the next step was to <em>optimize</em> it.</p>
<p>In order <strong>to improve the system, we must first understand it</strong>. Thus, I took the time to read through the RBC2 regulation, figure out what needed to be submitted and how the company operates to get that information.</p>
<p>Overall, I came out of it with a strong foundation of the RBC2 regulation and how an Insurance Company operates.</p>

<p>This is my first GI actuarial internship - so I spent a lot of time on my own learning about the different terminology and concepts used in the industry.</p>
<p>As the team was extremely small (2 people), we didn't have a single project to work on throughout but rather whatever needed to be done at the time (which was a lot!).</p>
<h4 id="24a-zurich-key-project-bau"><strong>2.4a Zurich Key Project - BAU</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#24a-zurich-key-project-bau" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Zurich Singapore is an extremely young business unit. Although they have had business since 2008, they only had an actuarial team based here in around 2017.</p>
<p>Unlike Income, Zurich did not have a lot of the necesary infrastructure in place - especially with a lot changes like RBC2/IFRS17/Group Policy. A lot of the work was thus to <em>build these processes from scratch</em>.</p>
<p>It involved pulling data from different sources, manipulating it to get the requirements and then checking against the original source data to see if it reconciles.</p>
<p>It is very low level work but the upside was that I got to better familiarize myself with all the <strong>concepts and terminology</strong> using in General Insurance - Paid, Case, IBNR, Assumed, Retroceded etc.</p>
<p>One of the projects I was working on was for IFRS17 where I helped to create a script to calculate <strong>Insurance Revenue</strong> rather than the traditional Earned Premium that was used for many years.</p>

<p>The main reason is because I felt that actuarial science provided me with a very <strong>clear and defined career path</strong> - take exams, work in insurance, learn insurance regulation; no need to stress about where!</p>

<p>Having had the opportunity to intern on both sides, I do have some <em>slight opinions</em> on it:</p>
<p><strong>Life Insurance</strong> is a very <em>established field</em> with many of the concepts already ironed out, allowing me to gain a <em>depth of experience</em> in the field. However, it may get repetitive and boring after awhile as nothing changes.</p>
<p><strong>General Insurance</strong> is an <em>evolving field</em> with many new risks and concepts, allowing me to gain a <em>breadth of experience</em> in the field. However, it is difficult to become an expert in any one field.</p>
<p>But my experiences as an intern probably only <em>scratched the surface</em> of the what each of them would end up doing - either way what is important is that I am open to learning new things!</p>

<p>Having had the opportunity to intern on both sides, I do have some <em>slight opinions</em> on it:</p>
<p><strong>Consulting</strong> allows me to work on a variety of projects, gaining a strong understanding of the big picture in the industry. However, my understanding of each function will not be as in depth.</p>
<p><strong>Direct</strong> allows me to go in depth into a specific function, becoming an expert in it. However, this makes it difficult to understand how the industry operates as I only have a limited view.</p>
<p>But I think either way regardless of where it is very <em>dependent on your attitude</em> - you can go to consulting and learn nothing or can go to direct and learn a lot!</p>
