  <h1>1 Reinsurance Overview</h1>

<p>Reinsurance is used for capital management
Company growing quickly &gt; Need more capital than steady state
Prefer not to use internal capital to support that growth &gt; rather invest in other aspects
cede part of business to reinsurers to reduce capital demands &gt; as growth slows, reduce the ceded portion and move back to 0 position</p>
<p>Reinsurance is global in natrure, very easy to move capital around</p>
<p>Reinsurance
What is Reinsurance?
•   As the name implies, it is Insurance for an Insurance company
•   A primary insurance company (“Cedant”) cedes out part of its underwritten risk to a Reinsurance company (“Reinsurer”) to limit exposure to losses. We say that the Reinsurer assumes responsibility for part of the loss
•   The Reinsurance company can also take up reinsurance to limit exposure to losses, known as Retrocession
o   Important that Reinsurance companies do not eventually form a circular loop where a reinsurer is reinsuring part of themselves
o   However, reinsurance may be provided for by another company in the corporate group. In this case, it is known as Captive Reinsurance
•   Thus, instead of Retroceding to another Reinsurance Company, they could Retrocede the risk to the Capital Markets instead in the form of Insurance-Linked-Securities (EG. Catastrophe Bonds)
•   Unlike regular insurance, one contract could involve several reinsurers at once or multiple reinsurance contracts could be issued to cover one risk (Each taking a different part of it)
•   However, the Cedant is not absolved of all risk. Having a reinsurance agreement in place does NOT relieve the obligations of the original insurer to the policyholder. They are reliant on the Reinsurer indemnifying them, thus there is still some level of Credit Risk that the Cedant is exposed to</p>
<p>Why Reinsurance?
•   Consider from an insurance company’s perspective, why they would want Reinsurance:
o   Precisely manage their risks. Insurers can choose which risks they want to retain and cede out the portion they don’t want to. This can be beneficially when trying to manoeuvre around regulatory solvency requirements
o   Stabilize business results. Instead of the potentially having high frequency or large claims, it is replaced with a fixed premium. This makes performance more predictable which could have tax benefits or relaxed capital requirements
o   Increase underwriting capacity. Since only a portion of the risk is actually assumed by the insurer, they can afford to write risks that would have otherwise been too big. This ensures that most events are insurable at an affordable price
o   Protect against Catastrophe Losses. Catastrophes often hit an entire region at a time, which would instantly bankrupt an insurer as their risks tend to be concentrated in a particular region. However, Reinsurers operate globally; thus they can afford to reinsurer for Catastrophe Risks
•   Reinsurance tends to focus more on the General Insurance side of things given the large risk that they write. However, there are trends in the Life Insurance side as well in the form of Financial Reinsurance</p>
<p>Captive Insurance
Setting up another insurance company to insure against your own losses
Main benefit is mainly capital constraints, tax, funding etc
Regulated alternative to self insurance &gt; Less tempted to take the money
Offer direct access to reinsurance and act as an investment vehicle</p>
<p>The problem with that approach is its lack of a formal structure, creating the temptation to access the funds for other purposes and ambiguity about how much coverage a firm actually has.
With a captive, on the other hand, the funds are segregated and held in a regulated, audited vehicle, which can help the firm go out and attain more cover from the reinsurance market. To be clear: the captive would insure only its parent company, not competitors.</p>
<p>aid over the years his firm has been quoted insurance many times at prices which were “ridiculous and obscene.”</p>
<p>If pricing is too high in the commercial insurance markets or no underwriters are willing to cover a firm’s risk, captives are used to formalize self-insurance with reporting on capital and reserve requirements. </p>
<p>Captives are typically set up for more niche products (though not always) so I suppose the only disadvantage is if you work on some niche product at a captive and then later that work doesn't translate to other more general career options. &gt; Hard to get priced</p>
<p>Introduction to Reinsurance Treaties
Based on policy coverage
Facultative Treaty
Contracts are underwritten on an individual risk basis; the reinsurer has the option to reject each risk    Contracts are underwritten for an entire class of business (Similar risk); reinsurer cannot reject any individual risk
•   There is a hybrid version known as Facultative Obligatory Treaty – The Cedant gets to decide which risks within the portfolio they want to Cede, and the Reinsurer cannot reject whatever they choose to cede out
•   Most reinsurance contracts are treaties, only a small ~15% are Facultative</p>
<p>Based on policy operation
Proportional (Pro-Rata) Non-Proportional (Excess of Loss; XL)
Quota Share Surplus Per Risk XL
(Working XL)    Per Event XL
(Cat XL)    Aggregate XL
(Stop Loss)
Covers a fixed percentage of the risk   Covers ALL surplus over a retention limit   Covers losses above the retention limit of the policy, up to the policy limit   Covers large losses from multiple policies from a single event (Catastrophe)    Covers losses based on overall frequency instead of size</p>
<p>Other points
•   Reinsurance contracts typically mirror the terms &amp; exclusions of the underlying risk it is insuring
•   Since Reinsurance is a contract surrounding two professional entities, the guidelines and regulations are very different compared to primary insurer
•   Financial Reinsurance is a very up and coming thing</p>
<p>Sum at risk of the reinsurer
Calculated at the benefit level for each individual benefit
Calculated based on the amount ceded to reinsurer</p>
<p>RI Premium = SAR * RI Premium Rate
Insurer will clacualte SAR and the corresponding premium, send to Reinsurer to verify and check
This is known as the Statement of Account</p>
<p>The basis is agreed beforehand with the insurer on how to calcualte SAR
Some SAR is complicated because some want/dont want to include SAR, because technically we are holding reserves for the benefits, nothing at risk to the reinsurer</p>
<p>Problem is that if this the case, then need to align on the reserving basis with the resinurer, which is hard for both parties to agree</p>
<p>All the terms is captured under the Treaty binding agreement</p>
