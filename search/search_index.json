Product Type \u00b6 There are several types of insurance that fall under the \"Life\" category. All of them insure against risks associated with the human life . This section will focus on the key ideas behind each type of product. It is NOT meant to cover the specific mechanics of how each product functions. Note that not all of the product types mentioned below are offered as a standalone product. Some are often combined with regular life insurance or offered as an optional rider to a regular life insurance plan. Life Insurance \u00b6 Life Insurance is a contract whereby the insurer will pay out a benefit to the beneficiary if the policyholder dies or becomes diagnosed with Terminal Illness . Individuals who die earlier than expected leave their dependents (who have yet to become financially independent) without financial support. Thus, life insurance helps to provide: Income Replacement : Replaces the income that would have been earned by the insured; allowing their dependents to maintain their current lifestyle Debt Repayment : Covers outstanding debts of the family (EG. Home Mortgage) There are also expenses associated with death (EG. Hospice, Funeral). The benefit payout can also be used to cover these expenses , ensuring that no financial burden was left onto their family. Total Permanent Disability \u00b6 Total Permanent Disability (TPD) insurance is a contract whereby the insurer will pay a benefit to the insured in the event that they become totally and permanently disabled . Most insurers use the some variation of the below definition for TPD: The inability to engage in any paid work Irrecoverable physical loss - loss of sight in both eyes, loss of two limbs or a loss of sight in one eye and loss of one limb Individuals who have TPD can no longer work . Thus, TPD insurance similarly provides Income replacement and Debt Repayment coverage for the beneficiaries of the insured. They also incur additional expenses that can be covered with the benefit pay out: Medical Expenses : Healthcare costs not covered by Health Insurance (Due to nature of treatment or coverage limit) Non-Medical Expenses : Cost of home modifications or assistive devices to aid living with TPD (EG. Wheelchair ramps or Communication aids) Since the benefit can be used to cover necessary expenses, it ensures that no financial burden falls upon the family of the insured. Additionally, it also preserves their own financial resources , allowing them to be used for their intended purposes (EG. Retirement or Children's Education). Note The above point can be made for all remaining products types that trigger a payout while the insured is still alive. There are three states that a policy can be in: In-Force - Required premiums have been paid and will remain active till the next premium due date Lapsed - Required premiums have NOT been paid and will become inactive from then on Paid Up - ALL required premiums have been paid and will remain active for the remaining duration of the policy Info There is usually a grace period of about 1 month for the insured to make the required premium payment after the premium due date . Most insurers allow a lapsed policy to be Reinstated within a specified window after it has lapsed. It typically involves paying the outstanding premiums since lapse. However, reinstatement is not guaranteed . Some insurers may require the individual to go through medical underwriting again. In such cases, the terms of the policy may be adjusted if the insured's condition has worsened. Regular Premium (RP) \u00b6 A Regular Premium policy must have premiums paid at regular intervals for the policy to remain in-force. From an Regardless which choice is chosen, the total premiums required are the same from an actuarial perspective . Thus, regular premiums tend to have the smallest magnitude . This option is suited for individuals who have a steady stream of income and are thus able to spread the cost of insurance over an extended period of time. Single Premium (SP) \u00b6 A Single Premium policy only needs to have premium paid once on inception. The policy becomes paid up from that point on. Naturally, single premiums would have the largest magnitude as the entire premium is being paid upfront. This option is suited for individuals with a large amount of liquid assets (typically obtained via a windfall) and are thus able to secure the insurance coverage in a single payment. Limited Pay (LP) \u00b6 A Limited Pay policy is a mixture of the above: Premiums must be paid at regular intervals for a fixed period ; premiums must be paid for the policy to remain in-force during this period After that period, the policy is paid up from that point on Premium size tends to be significantly larger than regular premiums The required period could be defined in two ways: Explicit - Payments required for a fixed number of years (EG. 20 years) Implicit - Payments required till a certain age (EG. Till age 65) This option is suited for individuals who either: Have unreliable streams of income; cannot afford to spread the cost Have high income ; can afford to pay the higher premiums Premium Mode \u00b6 The frequency at which premiums are paid is known as the Premium Mode . For most policies, premiums are to be paid annually by default. However, most insurers offer the option to pay premiums on a more frequent basis instead to suit individuals with different needs - Semi-Annually , Quarterly or Monthly . Generally speaking, premiums paid more frequently have a slightly higher magnitude when compared on the same basis: This is due to reflect the higher cost to accomodate more frequent payments: Opportunity cost of interest due to premiums being received later Higher expenses due to increased billing and processing Warning A common misconception is that paying a higher premium would contribute more to the cash value of the policy. The additional costs are entirely to reflect higher costs; insurers are typically indifferent between payment modes as the amount going to the insurance portion remains the same.","title":"**Life Products**"},{"location":"0_INSURANCE/1_Life_Products/#life-products","text":"This section is meant to provide an overview of the key features of the different types of life insurance policies and their common variations.","title":"Life Products"},{"location":"0_INSURANCE/1_Life_Products/#product-type","text":"There are several types of insurance that fall under the \"Life\" category.

This allows the financial loss (which would have been disastrous for a single insured) to be spread among the group , becoming manageable for all. Consider a simple example to illustrate the concept: There are 10 people inside the risk pool, each with a potential risk of $100. We know for sure that 1 out of the 10 people will experience this $100 loss the next year. If someone experiences a loss, then everyone within the pool will fork out $10 each. This forms the $100 needed to cover the 1 unlucky person who experiences the $100 loss. No matter whether an individual experiences the loss or not, they only end up paying $10 to the pool . An insurance company helps to make the process more efficient by collecting the amount to be paid by each person beforehand (premiums) and then paying out the full amount to the unlucky individual shortly after the loss occurs. This also avoids the potential problem of someone not willing to pay their share. This assumes that each risk in the pool statistically independent of one another, where it is extremely unlikely that a large portion of the insureds in the pool will make a claim at at the same time. This allows the insurer to collect a fixed and relatively low premium from every single insured and use them to pay only the small portion of insureds that makes a claim. Law of Large Numbers \u00b6 Another key assumption of risk pooling is that the insurer knows the Frequency and Severity of the loss, thus knowing the risk of the insured. \\[ \\displaylines{ Risk = Frequency * Severity \\\\ Expected~Loss = Probability~of~Loss * Amount~of~Loss } \\] Unlike determining the probability of a fair dice throw, there is no intuitive logic that can be used to derive these two values. Thus, the insurer needs to estimate them from historical data - from publicly available studies or their own studies on their insureds. These estimates are formally known as Assumptions . The actual values are known as the Experience of the insurer. If the insurer has a sufficiently large pool of statistically independent insureds , then through the Law of Large Numbers , the estimated loss will be close to the actual loss of the group. This is because in a sufficiently large group, on average , the positive and negative deviations will offset one another, leaving the estimate to be close to experience . Thus, the estimates can be used to reasonably predict the actual losses from the pool of poliyholders, allowing the insurance company to calculate an adequate premium to maintain the risk pool. In practice, most insurers also include premium provisions for other expenses and/or a profit margin. Through Risk Pooling and the Law of Large numbers, unpredictable individual risk becomes predictable pooled risk . This is identical to the concept of Portfolio Diversification in finance, where the Non-Systematic Risks (EG. An individual house catches fire) of the insureds are removed by pooling them together. The insurer still faces some level of Systematic Risk that cannot be pooled away (EG. Asteroid hits earth and destroys all houses), but this is significantly smaller than any of the individual risks, which is why the insurer is willing to take on the risks of many. Reserves \u00b6 The law of large numbers only guarantees that the derived probability will always be true on average , over multiple events. There could be times where the derived probability is different from the true probability, leading to differences between the actual and expected losses for the insurer. Since the insurer collects premiums to cover for only the expected losses, a larger than expected loss in one particular year would mean that the insurer requires additional capital to pay off the claims. Thus, insurers are required to set aside a Reserve for their policies, where they can draw upon in times of larger than expected loss. The reserve is meant to supplement the collected premiums in situations where the premiums were insufficient, to ensure that the insurer will be able to fulfil their claims, even in the unlikely event of larger than expected losses. Insurers simulate these larger than expected losses by shocking the assumptions used. The shock is often referred to as a Margin for Adverse Deviation and is typically determined by the insurer. Low Margin High Margin Lower simulated loss Higher simulated loss Lower reserve held Larger reserve held Lower opportunity cost Higher opportunity cost May not be able to fulfil claims Should be able to fulfil claims Each country has their own set of specific regulations on how the reserves should be calculated and how much capital must be actually held, which will be covered in their own respective sections. Asymmetric Information \u00b6 The biggest problem in the insurance industry comes from Asymmetric Information - a situation where one party has more information than the other party, allowing one side to take advantage of it, to the other's detriment. In insurance context, the two parties are the Seller (Insurance Company) and the Buyer (insured). Each side has little incentive to disclose any additional negative information that they have. Buyer Ignorance \u00b6 The most understood form of asymmetry is known as Buyer Ignorance , where the seller has more information as compared to the buyer. This is detrimental to the buyer as they end up buying a product that appears good but is actually defective (Lemon) in some manner that the seller was aware of, but not the buyer. This occurred because of the Ignorance of the Buyer , who was unable to identify the defects. The average person would not be able to properly assess the value of an insurance policy or the financial health of the insurance company due to complicated nature of the product and the inconsistent jargon used across the industry. This could result in them purchasing less desirable policies that they otherwise would not have. This is the reason why the insurance industry is heavily regulated across the globe - in order to level the playing field and combat buyer ignorance. For instance, regulators constantly monitor the financial health of insurance companies to ensure that they are solvent and require certain kinds of insurance to be purchased through a representative that will explain the terms of the contract. Moral Hazard \u00b6 Moral Hazard refers to a situation where the buyer has more information as compared to the seller. After being insured, insureds have an incentive to engage in riskier behavior relative to before they were insured. This is because sine they do not have to bear the cost of the actions , they become less careful and engage in riskier behaviour that they otherwise would not have before. Ex Ante - Changes Loss Prevention behaviour; EG. Driving more recklessly, increasing the Frequency of accidents Ex Post - Changes Loss Minimization behaviour; EG. Increasing the scope of car repairs, increasing the Severity of accidents The effect is that this increases the frequencies and/or severities of the losses after the insurance contract has been made, which means that the premiums charged are not sufficient to cover the higher expected losses as a result of the moral hazard. This forces the insurer to increase premiums for all insureds to account for the increased losses due to the behaviour of a few. There are four mechanisms to work around moral hazard, ensuring that there is no incentive to engage in riskier behaviour: Insurable Interest - The insured must have some significant relation to what is being insured. They should benefit MORE from the insured event NOT occuring rather than occurring. Indemnity - Insurance should compensate for a loss, returning the insured back to their original position before the loss. The insured should not be left better off after an insurance claim Contribution - If the insured owns multiple policies , then each policy will only compensate a portion of the amount, with the total equivalent to the loss. This is to ensure that the insured cannot seek compensation more than once; cannot be left better off after the insured event Subrogation - If the insured experienced loss as a result of a third party, they forfeit the legal right to seek compensation from the third party. This is to ensure that the insured cannot seek compensation more than once; cannot be left better off after the insured event Additionally, they could introduce an element of responsibility on the insureds end by introducing one or more cost sharing mechanisms : Co-payments - A fixed amount that must be paid for by the insured Deductible - A fixed amount of the remaining claim that must be paid for by the insured Co-insurance - Proportion of the remaining claim that must be paid for by the insured Claim limits - Maximum amount that the insurer will cover in a single claim or over a period; excess is paid for by the insured Insureds typically have an option if they would like to have these cost sharing mechanisms in their policy. Naturally, policies with cost sharings have lower premiums than those without as they minimize moral hazard. Adverse Selection \u00b6 Adverse Selection refers to a situation where the buyer has more information as compared to the seller. Due to the nature of insurance, it often attracts more high risk insureds than low risk ones. This results in the risk pool being systematically biased towards high risk insureds, causing the average claims experience to be higher than that of a randomly selected group, to the insurers detriment as they are not charging enough premiums . Thus, there is a natural selection of high risk insureds to join the pool, leading to adverse outcomes for insurers. This occurs because the insurer does not have enough information about the insured to distinguish between high and low risk ones. Thus, high risk insureds have an incentive to NOT disclose their additional information (to be charged lower), misrepresenting their risk profile. This means that high risk and low risk insureds will be the paying the same premium. However, the higher risk individuals are underpaying relative to the risk they add to the pool while lower risk insureds are overpaying relative to the risk they add to the pool. The low risk insureds are essentially subsidising the higher risk ones, which is unfair to them. This causes actual losses to be consistently larger than the expected loss (which they priced for), causing the insurer lose money over time. This would force the insurer to increase premiums to compensate for the loss, prompting genuinely low risk insureds to leave the pool as they will realise thay are overpaying for their insurance. This further worsens the problem, as they recieve even lesser premiums than before, experiencing an even larger loss, increasing premiums once more. Eventually, the premiums are so high that no one will be willing to buy insurance anymore , causing the system to fail. The most natural way to work around this is to obtain more information about the prospective insured to properly assess their risk. insureds will then be charged a premium proportional to the level of risk that they bring, overcoming the effects of adverse selection. This process is formally known as Underwriting , which will be covered in greater detail in the next section. Alternatively, if it was mandatory to have the insurance, then low risk individuals cannot drop out of the pool, allowing the insurer to charge a higher premium without the system failing. A similar effect can also be achieved by offering Group Insurance , which typically consists of a good mix of high and low risk individuals. Insurance paradox - if you want insurance, is damn suspicious EG. Why you want? Is it you suddenly find out u got critical illness? Underwriting \u00b6 To underwrite a policy is to guarantee that the terms of the insurance policy will be upheld. This definition is similar to the finance definition, where the a financial institution underwrites a share issuance, guaranteeing that all shares will be sold (by purchasing unsold ones themselves). In the insurance specific context, Underwriting is a screening process of determining the risk of a prospective insured and charging them a premium proportional to the determined level of risk, excluding them from certain coverage or refusing to underwrite the policy totally. Essentially, the insurer price discriminates insureds based on their level of risk, with the goal of detecting and detering adverse selection . The screening process typically involves the requesting information relevant to the risk and their supporting documents. Insurance contracts are legally bound by the principle of Utmost Good Faith , which means that both parties must enter the contract in good faith - without the ill intention of deceiving the other. If it was found that the insured withheld material information (intentionally or not) from the insurer, the insurer thus has the right to void the policy and remove its obligation to pay out the claim. Insurers then place the insured into one of various Risk Classifications that are based on Demographic Factors (Age, Gender, Smoking Status) or other relevant Individual Factors . Using these characteristics, insurers estimate the risk of a typical insured within the class. Using the estimates and the desired level of coverage, an appropriate level of premium is calculated. In an ideal world, the insurer would like to precisely determine the risk of the insured. However, it is often hard to obtain the necessary information to do so because the insured would not disclose it, does not know about it or the necessary information simply does not exist. Thus, the risk classification provides an as precise as possible estimation of the risk, but it is not guaranteed to be perfect. For instance, smokers are statistically more vulnerable to developing certain types of Cancers. However, a particular smoker may have a genertic pre-disposition that prevents him from developing cancer. Since this information is usually inaccessible, the smoker will be charged according to the general trend. Risk classifications are more accurate when there is more data available about the risk . As such, classifications for personal insurance tend to be extremely accurate as every individual experience similar risks. Conversely, commercial insurance classifications are not as accurate as the risks that each business faces is different from one another, thus cannot be used to accurately predict losses. Thus, commerical premiums may be significantly different from the risk classifications, as the underwriter may exercise their professional judgment to adjust the premiums based on their perceived risk of the insured (subject to various company level underwriting guidelines). There is a trade off in Underwriting when it comes to high risk insureds. On one hand there is an inherent desire to write more business , which can be done by lowering premiums to incentivise them to take go forward with the insurance policy. On the other hand, a high risk insured below the required premiums adds unnecessary risk to the pool. The tension between these two goals is especially strong because high risk does not necessarily translate to actual losses. However, insurance is one of the few industries where they can earn more by selling less , thus it is generally safer to write fewer risky accounts (earning less in premiums) than many risky accounts (earning more in premiums), as the long run claims typically have a greater impact than premiums. How Insurance makes money \u00b6 Timing Problem \u00b6 Most traditional companies know the cost of their product before the sell it. For instance, a phone manufacturer knows exactly how much it costs to produce a phone, thus they know that the difference in their price and cost is the amount they will make or lose. Insurance Financials \u2022 Insurance companies operate very differently from a traditional company - They collect Revenue (Premiums) BEFORE knowing the Cost (Claims) of their products \u2022 Since they may eventually have to pay out a claim, they cannot recognize these premiums as profits or freely use the capital they have gained \u2022 They have to hold enough liquid capital in order to pay off potential future claims. This amount is known as the Reserves, determined by the actuarial department o \u2022 Companies can only recognize profit (Accounting sense) from insurance through a release of reserves. Reserves are typically conservative (Larger than what they expect to pay). Thus, if the actual experience reserves are lower than the reserve, the excess can be recognized as profit for the company \u2022 Standard accounting principles state that revenues and expenses must match the period in which they were recognised \u2013 but insurance is different. Thus, they have to follow a special set of accounting rules \u2013 IFRS17 How do Insurance Companies make money? Investment Income \u2022 The main way they make money is through Investments. As stated earlier, there is a significant time gap between when premiums are paid and when a potential claim is made, if any at all. Insurers can invest the money during this time to generate revenue o Capital set aside as part of the reserves can only be invested in less risky assets such as Government Bonds or high-grade Corporate Bonds, which naturally yields a lower return o Remaining capital can be invested freely according to the insurer\u2019s appetite in other asset classes as well (Equities etc) o Therefore, setting the reserves is so important \u2013 too high a reserve limits the investment capital while too low may put the company in financial distress \u2022 Therefore, insurance is known as a capital business \u2013 They obtain capital via Insurance Contracts for investments. Insurance contracts are a special form of Debt, thus this whole process of investment is akin to the concept of Financial Leverage \u2022 The competitive advantage of using insurance policies is that unlike regular debt, there is no fixed maturity date (if any at all) and no fixed redemption value (if any at all). But this is also the same reasons insurers are prone to financial distress o Thus, we can think of Insurance as a highly leveraged business o Berkshire Hathaway is a great example. Warren Buffet is known for his great investments, but not many realise that his investment capital comes from the insurance and reinsurance wing of Berkshire Hathaway \u2022 This is still a very high-level understanding of the process \u2013 it is actually a very complex process with only a few strategic personnel knowing how it works Underwriting Profit \u2022 Another way that they can earn money is through Underwriting Profit \u2013 the difference between the premiums collected and what is paid out in claims and expenses \u2022 Most people believe that this is the main way that insurers make money given that this is what most consumers are exposed to. This idea is also perpetuated because of the misguided notion that insurers deny claims to increase profit \u2022 However, for many lines of insurance, the UW profit is often small, if not negative Overview of Life Insurance \u00b6 Death is inevitable - Instead of focusing on if the policyholder will die, it is focused on when they will die Life is immeasurable - Instead of indemnity, it provides a pre-specified amount chosen by the insured, known as the Sum Assured (SA) Insured is dead - Instead of paying out to the insured, the payout is given to an appointed individual , known as the Beneficiary Thus, Life Insurance is a contract where the Insurer pays the Death Benefit (Equal to the Sum Assured) to the appointed Beneficiary upon the death of the insured.","title":"**Insurance Concepts**"},{"location":"0_INSURANCE/2_Insurance_Concepts/#insurance-concepts","text":"","title":"Insurance Concepts"},{"location":"0_INSURANCE/2_Insurance_Concepts/#how-insurance-works","text":"","title":"How Insurance works"},{"location":"0_INSURANCE/2_Insurance_Concepts/#risk-pooling","text":"Insurers are willing to take on the risk of the insured because if they can take on the risk of other insureds, they can pool the risks together . This allows the financial loss (which would have been disastrous for a single insured) to be spread among the group , becoming manageable for all. Consider a simple example to illustrate the concept: There are 10 people inside the risk pool, each with a potential risk of $100. We know for sure that 1 out of the 10 people will experience this $100 loss the next year. If someone experiences a loss, then everyone within the pool will fork out $10 each. This forms the $100 needed to cover the 1 unlucky person who experiences the $100 loss. No matter whether an individual experiences the loss or not, they only end up paying $10 to the pool . An insurance company helps to make the process more efficient by collecting the amount to be paid by each person beforehand (premiums) and then paying out the full amount to the unlucky individual shortly after the loss occurs. This also avoids the potential problem of someone not willing to pay their share. This assumes that each risk in the pool statistically independent of one another, where it is extremely unlikely that a large portion of the insureds in the pool will make a claim at at the same time. This allows the insurer to collect a fixed and relatively low premium from every single insured and use them to pay only the small portion of insureds that makes a claim.","title":"Risk Pooling"},{"location":"0_INSURANCE/2_Insurance_Concepts/#law-of-large-numbers","text":"Another key assumption of risk pooling is that the insurer knows the Frequency and Severity of the loss, thus knowing the risk of the insured. \\[ \\displaylines{ Risk = Frequency * Severity \\\\ Expected~Loss = Probability~of~Loss * Amount~of~Loss } \\] Unlike determining the probability of a fair dice throw, there is no intuitive logic that can be used to derive these two values. Thus, the insurer needs to estimate them from historical data - from publicly available studies or their own studies on their insureds. These estimates are formally known as Assumptions . The actual values are known as the Experience of the insurer. If the insurer has a sufficiently large pool of statistically independent insureds , then through the Law of Large Numbers , the estimated loss will be close to the actual loss of the group. This is because in a sufficiently large group, on average , the positive and negative deviations will offset one another, leaving the estimate to be close to experience . Thus, the estimates can be used to reasonably predict the actual losses from the pool of poliyholders, allowing the insurance company to calculate an adequate premium to maintain the risk pool. In practice, most insurers also include premium provisions for other expenses and/or a profit margin. Through Risk Pooling and the Law of Large numbers, unpredictable individual risk becomes predictable pooled risk . This is identical to the concept of Portfolio Diversification in finance, where the Non-Systematic Risks (EG. An individual house catches fire) of the insureds are removed by pooling them together. The insurer still faces some level of Systematic Risk that cannot be pooled away (EG. Asteroid hits earth and destroys all houses), but this is significantly smaller than any of the individual risks, which is why the insurer is willing to take on the risks of many.","title":"Law of Large Numbers"},{"location":"0_INSURANCE/2_Insurance_Concepts/#reserves","text":"The law of large numbers only guarantees that the derived probability will always be true on average , over multiple events. There could be times where the derived probability is different from the true probability, leading to differences between the actual and expected losses for the insurer. Since the insurer collects premiums to cover for only the expected losses, a larger than expected loss in one particular year would mean that the insurer requires additional capital to pay off the claims. Thus, insurers are required to set aside a Reserve for their policies, where they can draw upon in times of larger than expected loss. The reserve is meant to supplement the collected premiums in situations where the premiums were insufficient, to ensure that the insurer will be able to fulfil their claims, even in the unlikely event of larger than expected losses. Insurers simulate these larger than expected losses by shocking the assumptions used. The shock is often referred to as a Margin for Adverse Deviation and is typically determined by the insurer. Low Margin High Margin Lower simulated loss Higher simulated loss Lower reserve held Larger reserve held Lower opportunity cost Higher opportunity cost May not be able to fulfil claims Should be able to fulfil claims Each country has their own set of specific regulations on how the reserves should be calculated and how much capital must be actually held, which will be covered in their own respective sections.","title":"Reserves"},{"location":"0_INSURANCE/2_Insurance_Concepts/#asymmetric-information","text":"The biggest problem in the insurance industry comes from Asymmetric Information - a situation where one party has more information than the other party, allowing one side to take advantage of it, to the other's detriment. In insurance context, the two parties are the Seller (Insurance Company) and the Buyer (insured). Each side has little incentive to disclose any additional negative information that they have.","title":"Asymmetric Information"},{"location":"0_INSURANCE/2_Insurance_Concepts/#buyer-ignorance","text":"The most understood form of asymmetry is known as Buyer Ignorance , where the seller has more information as compared to the buyer. This is detrimental to the buyer as they end up buying a product that appears good but is actually defective (Lemon) in some manner that the seller was aware of, but not the buyer. This occurred because of the Ignorance of the Buyer , who was unable to identify the defects. The average person would not be able to properly assess the value of an insurance policy or the financial health of the insurance company due to complicated nature of the product and the inconsistent jargon used across the industry. This could result in them purchasing less desirable policies that they otherwise would not have. This is the reason why the insurance industry is heavily regulated across the globe - in order to level the playing field and combat buyer ignorance. For instance, regulators constantly monitor the financial health of insurance companies to ensure that they are solvent and require certain kinds of insurance to be purchased through a representative that will explain the terms of the contract.","title":"Buyer Ignorance"},{"location":"0_INSURANCE/2_Insurance_Concepts/#moral-hazard","text":"Moral Hazard refers to a situation where the buyer has more information as compared to the seller. After being insured, insureds have an incentive to engage in riskier behavior relative to before they were insured. This is because sine they do not have to bear the cost of the actions , they become less careful and engage in riskier behaviour that they otherwise would not have before. Ex Ante - Changes Loss Prevention behaviour; EG. Driving more recklessly, increasing the Frequency of accidents Ex Post - Changes Loss Minimization behaviour; EG. Increasing the scope of car repairs, increasing the Severity of accidents The effect is that this increases the frequencies and/or severities of the losses after the insurance contract has been made, which means that the premiums charged are not sufficient to cover the higher expected losses as a result of the moral hazard. This forces the insurer to increase premiums for all insureds to account for the increased losses due to the behaviour of a few. There are four mechanisms to work around moral hazard, ensuring that there is no incentive to engage in riskier behaviour: Insurable Interest - The insured must have some significant relation to what is being insured. They should benefit MORE from the insured event NOT occuring rather than occurring. Indemnity - Insurance should compensate for a loss, returning the insured back to their original position before the loss. The insured should not be left better off after an insurance claim Contribution - If the insured owns multiple policies , then each policy will only compensate a portion of the amount, with the total equivalent to the loss. This is to ensure that the insured cannot seek compensation more than once; cannot be left better off after the insured event Subrogation - If the insured experienced loss as a result of a third party, they forfeit the legal right to seek compensation from the third party. This is to ensure that the insured cannot seek compensation more than once; cannot be left better off after the insured event Additionally, they could introduce an element of responsibility on the insureds end by introducing one or more cost sharing mechanisms : Co-payments - A fixed amount that must be paid for by the insured Deductible - A fixed amount of the remaining claim that must be paid for by the insured Co-insurance - Proportion of the remaining claim that must be paid for by the insured Claim limits - Maximum amount that the insurer will cover in a single claim or over a period; excess is paid for by the insured Insureds typically have an option if they would like to have these cost sharing mechanisms in their policy. Naturally, policies with cost sharings have lower premiums than those without as they minimize moral hazard.","title":"Moral Hazard"},{"location":"0_INSURANCE/2_Insurance_Concepts/#adverse-selection","text":"Adverse Selection refers to a situation where the buyer has more information as compared to the seller. Due to the nature of insurance, it often attracts more high risk insureds than low risk ones. This results in the risk pool being systematically biased towards high risk insureds, causing the average claims experience to be higher than that of a randomly selected group, to the insurers detriment as they are not charging enough premiums . Thus, there is a natural selection of high risk insureds to join the pool, leading to adverse outcomes for insurers. This occurs because the insurer does not have enough information about the insured to distinguish between high and low risk ones. Thus, high risk insureds have an incentive to NOT disclose their additional information (to be charged lower), misrepresenting their risk profile. This means that high risk and low risk insureds will be the paying the same premium. However, the higher risk individuals are underpaying relative to the risk they add to the pool while lower risk insureds are overpaying relative to the risk they add to the pool. The low risk insureds are essentially subsidising the higher risk ones, which is unfair to them. This causes actual losses to be consistently larger than the expected loss (which they priced for), causing the insurer lose money over time. This would force the insurer to increase premiums to compensate for the loss, prompting genuinely low risk insureds to leave the pool as they will realise thay are overpaying for their insurance. This further worsens the problem, as they recieve even lesser premiums than before, experiencing an even larger loss, increasing premiums once more. Eventually, the premiums are so high that no one will be willing to buy insurance anymore , causing the system to fail.

Because underwriting is about discriminating individuals for the sake of efficiency, it may contravene antidiscrimination legislation, espe- cially when the classification matches with the membership to historically disadvantaged groups (in terms of opportunities, resources, welfare, etc.) in order to impose differentiated premiums to the members of such groups, higher than those paid by the members of other, more historically advantaged, groups. Underwriting practices, which address adverse selection, may be seen as discriminatory or unjust while trying to guarantee or to maximize effi- ciency, insurers create situations that contravene moral intuitions about justice and fairness. To answer your question, insurance companies will invest the pool of money they recieve from premium payments into what are known as Mutual Funds, which are investment funds aimed at reaching a fixed or benchmark rate of return, with this rate of return structured so as to compensate the insurance company for the risk from the policies they issue that cant be removed through diversification of their portfolio. Then why not extend this segmentation by classifying people according to family history of disease or genetics, for instance? Because, currently, it is not easy to segment the population in this way, and there may not be a large enough difference in mortality rates to justify the expense of segmentation. There will also certainly be political and social resistance to this degree of segmentation, since it will be viewed as an invasion of privacy and discrimination. Of course, basing life insurance premiums on sex and smoking status can also be viewed as discriminatory, but it has a sound actuarial basis. However, sex and smoking status, unlike family history or genetics, are easily observable traits, and, thus, cannot be considered an invasion of privacy. Nonetheless, as technology advances, segmentation based on genetics will be attempted. While many view it as discriminatory, others will argue, and rightly so, that to not allow it would force others to subsidize the premiums of others. Since insurance rates are determined by the death rate of the insured, including people with a higher death rate at the same premium would make the premium higher for all. As with the different rates for sex and smoking status, companies will offer better rates to those willing to show their good genetic profiles, which, in turn, will cause adverse selection for the other companies not using genetics, forcing them either to raise their premiums for all or to start using genetic profiles as well. Insurance Trends Insuretech \u2022 It refers to technology that are meant to make the insurance industry more efficient \u2022 Tech company that connects to the insurance world, not the other way round \u2022 According to OW, there are three types of insuretech to varying degrees (Seen below) \u2022 Insuretech represents innovation in the industry \u2013 which is commonly thrown around as a buzzword \u2022 Should companies rush towards insuretech? The answer is simple \u2013 only if it is profitable to do so, not just for the sake of getting new technology Distribution Based Insuretech \u2022 Most people are consumers of Insurance. Thus, the most common forms of Insuretech they would see are Distribution based \u2013 Lemonade, Hippo Insurance etc. \u2022 Taking Lemonade as an example, they use technology to help underwrite products without the need for an intermediary or underwriter, saving on these costs (~25%) o But are they truly making money? o Depending on how they choose to treat R&D (One-time expense VS Amortize) the numbers could look very different \u2013 hard to offset large R&D costs o It is reported that even till today these companies are still making losses \u2022 Will these distribution based insuretech take over? While some consumers are glad to be able to save costs by going direct, others (especially less knowledgeable ones) prefer to have an expert explain it to them and help them plan rather than taking time off their already busy lives to stress about it \u2022 In the most extreme case, it is predicted that we will no longer have any intermediaries in the future \u2013 Given your data, AI will assess your background and prompt you to increase your coverage etc o In terms of Life insurance, given that there are no more commissions, this will encourage policyholders to buy additional savings o However, the problem with this is about getting the data into the system as well as regulatory concerns \u2013 still need an FA for investment products, Data laws etc Big Data/Machine Learning \u2022 As technology becomes advanced and integrated into our lives, companies will have much more data to work with to determine how to price us, especially with newer cutting-edge machine learning techniques \u2022 At the centre of it all is the use Telematics \u2013 technology that can be used to directly collect data. Currently, it mainly refers to Car Telematics, but other similar devices already exist such as the Apple Watch or other lifestyle tracking devices \u2022 These telematic devices will be used to collect more precise data which can then be used to properly rate the policy. Some ethical concerns have been raised about whether insurers have the right to these data \u2013 but studies have shown that most consumers do not mind giving up this data if it can lead to lower premiums \u2022 However, pricing premiums too accurately could threaten the risk pool. Regulators may step in, but it will definitely be some time before that happens as legislation always lags behind technological development \u2022 An alternative way we can see this happening is when Insurance begins to move in-house \u2013 EG. Tesla & Shopee. These companies will know more about the risk than a third-party insurer, thus they can more accurately price premiums, allowing them to be more competitive than traditional insurers Rise of Specialty Insurance \u2022 A smaller trend would be the development of new kinds of products \u2013 Pet Insurance, Drone Insurance & Cyber insurance to name a few \u2022 We should expect even more products to match changes in societal norms over time SNACK by income > Micro insurance to build up insurance covderage in small amounts and offer rebates from spending In the form insurance coverage Tribe by Income > Netflix subscription style insurance Singlife Digital ILP > Monitor and track ILP performance Prudential PULSE > Provides access to healthcare services, telemedicine SGfindex > Could include insurance coverage as well Insurance Market in Singapore Life Insurance VS General Insurance Size \u2022 Life Insurance market is larger than General in Singapore. This is the opposite of larger nations like the US, where the General Insurance sector is (slightly) larger \u2022 Naturally, this means that there is a greater demand for GI actuaries in other countries \u2022 Larger number of policyholders means that they have more data/experience to use for more complex statistical methods (Machine Learning), warranting higher pay there \u2022 Thus, the advice is to stick to Life Insurance if you want to stay in SG or do GI if you want the opportunity to work overseas in the future Why Life is bigger in Singapore? \u2022 Seems a bit counter-intuitive at first because the number of Lives is limited while Cars/Corporations are not \u2013 but do they really outnumber people? (Nope) \u2022 Another reason could be due to the Saving/Investment component of Life Insurance \u2013 there is no limit to the amount you can choose to put into it. Coupled with the Asian mindset, this leads to larger premiums for Life o The Asian mindset may push them to prefer products where they can at least take access some cash value at any time \u2013 \u201ctangible\u201d o Additionally, they may also prefer the ability to pass on some wealth to the next generation or relieve their burden (Opposite of Western) Why Life is smaller in other countries? \u2022 Other countries naturally have a larger population size \u2013 more things to insure, making General Insurance naturally much larger \u2022 Another aspect to consider is the regulation surrounding Life Insurance \u2013 the Savings/Investment aspect of policies there might be structured differently which may push people to invest on their own or in their pension rather than Life Insurance Life Insurance Landscape \uf0a7 SG has a small but developed population \u2013 most would already own a Life Insurance from one of the major players (Purchased themselves or via parents) o However, the Protection Gap in SG is much larger than expected \uf0a7 The gameplan for Life Insurance in SG is not to sell as many policies as possible (Not realistic due to limited population) but rather to target up-market with wealth accumulation style policies o This is why smaller & more specialized insurers have continued to exist as they serve expats or other High Net Worth (HNW) clients o Suspected that they could be a front for money laundering as well! \uf0a7 Mainstream companies (Pru, GE, AIA etc) are also beginning to do this with an increasing focus on Investment products etc Mergers and Acquisitions in SG \u2022 2010: Prudential acquired UOB Life \u2022 2018: Singlife acquired Zurich Life \u2022 2020: Singlife acquired Aviva \u2022 2021: HSBC acquired AXA Singapore in the Region \u2022 The biggest competitor to Singapore is Hong Kong \u2013 All financial institutions want to be in Hong Kong to tap into the large Chinese market \u2022 However, HK is still a part of China \u2013 Chinese investors may want to move their investments outside of China completely and will choose Singapore \u2022 Singapore is also a central hub to other HNW individuals within the ASEAN region, which is why we will always remain relevan","title":"Dump"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/0_TERM_LIFE/","text":"Term Life Insurance \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 The most basic type of life insurance is known as Term Insurance . As its name suggests, it provides an insurance cover ONLY for a specific timeframe , known as the term of the policy. Most insurers offer a term plans till a specified age OR for a specified number of years (usually in multiples of 5 or 10). If the insured event does NOT occur during the policy term, the policy will expire and NO benefits will be paid at all . For this reason, term life insurance has the lowest premiums among other life insurance plan types with similar coverage. Note The most basic term plan is one that only covers Death. It is easy to compare these plans across insurers, which makes it price competitive , which is another reason why it tends to be cheaper. Term plans are best suited for individuals with financial obligations that only last for a limited period of time , such as during a loan repayment or till a child becomes financially independent. Guaranteed Renewability \u00b6 Term plans can offer Guaranteed Renewability . This allows the policyholder to renew the term policy at expiration to provide coverage again for the same duration. It is meant to provide flexibility for insureds with uncertain long-term financial obligations or for those with difficulty affording long-term coverage at the moment. Note Upon renewal, the premiums of the policyholder will increase to reflect the higher mortality due to age and the ultimate mortality . Health tends to deteriorate with age, thus should the insured want to purchase a new policy after the original, they might be rejected or priced out . Guaranteed Renewability overcomes this as it ensures the insured retains their coverage WITHOUT needing to go through medical underwriting. However, such guaranteed renewability features might result in Adverse Selection . Healthy insured may instead choose to go through medical underwriting to purchase a new plan at a potentially lower rate; leaving only unhealthy insureds in the renewed pool. To combat this, some insurers offer a re-entry option that allows policyholders to voluntarily go through medical underwriting upon renewal to obtain lower premiums, incentivizing healthy insured to renew as well. Note It is known as re-entry as the policyholder re-enters the Select Mortality Group upon renewal. Warning Only select riders that are attachable to the plan can be renewed on a guaranteed basis. Yearly Renewable \u00b6 The most extreme version of renewability is for a plan with a one year term that is guaranteed renewable; typically known as Yearly Renewable Term (YRT). Pure YRTs are often not sold in practice, but serves as a baseline for understanding more complex products. The premiums for a YRT plan increase every year , reflecting the increasing mortality with age. Compared to an otherwise equal traditional level premium term plan, the YRT is cheaper when young but is significantly more expensive when old : The key difference is that the level premium approach essentially pre-pays the premium ahead of time, allowing them to accumulate with interest to cover the high mortality costs at later ages, requiring only a reasonably small level premium. This is in contrast to YRT requires the individual to pay equal to their mortality cost for that year . At later ages, most individuals have little to no income, making them unable to afford coverage, forcing them to lapse the policy when they are most at risk of death. This is why YRTs are never sold in practice. Note The pre-payment of future mortality cost can also be known as \"Front Loading\" the mortality costs. Lapse Supportability \u00b6 A lapse supported product is one where higher than expected lapses result in higher profitability; the insurer tends to be better off from lapses . If policyholders lapse their policy before the mortality costs increases substantially above the premium, they have essentially forfeited their front load partially or entirely, resulting in profits for the insurer . Warning The timing of lapse is important. Life insurance policies typically have high acquisition costs , that are gradually recovered over the life of the policy. If the lapse occurs too early, the insurer would not have recovered these costs and might result in a loss instead. Lapse supportability is most prevalent in term insurance given that it has no cash values ; nothing is returned on lapse. The extent of lapse supportability is dependent on the size of the front load . Term-to-100 is the common example of a highly lapse supported product, due to the high mortality costs at the tail end of life that are front loaded. Note Lapse supportability still exists for whole life insurance as the cash values paid are often smaller than the front load , still resulting in profits to the insurer. The extent is dependent on the relative size of the cash value and the front load. Lapse supported pricing refers to projecting lapses during pricing, where the insurer expects to earn lapse profits. Policies that are projected to lapse are subsidizing those that remain in-force, resulting in an overall lower cost for the entire portfolio, allowing them to charge lower premiums . The key risk of such an approach is that the lapse experience emerges to be much less than expected . This is a likely outcome, as assuming a high lapse rate results in lower premiums, which increases the perceived value of coverage which in turn should lower lapse rates . Actual credible experience will only emerge many years later, at which there will be a large shortfall in reserve , potentially leading to large losses or insolvency. To combat this, some insurers offer the lapse supported premiums as non-guaranteed , allowing them to increase the premiums if lapses do not emerge as expected. Note Companies cannot simply assume high lapses during pricing; they need actual historical experience to back the assumption . Thus, lapses should not be viewed negatively; some degree of lapse support is necessary to remain competitive. Generally speaking, lapse supportability is a sort of taboo topic due to the bad optics ; it involves the insurer gaining at the expense of the policyholder. Non-Level Benefits \u00b6 Term plans cans also offer non-level benefits, with the ability for the benefit to change over the lifetime of the policy. Increasing benefits are suited for invididuals with financial obligations that are expected to increase over time: Inflation will increase the price of goods and services over time Lifestyle inflation where individuals tend to make more expensive lifestyle choices as their income grows Parents with kids tend to have large one-off expenses due to University or Marriage that occur much later Note An increasing benefit term policy can be thought of as a combination of: Level benefit term plan equal to the starting benefit Level benefit term plan \"purchased\" each period to account for the increase in coverage For the (2), since the additional coverage is \"purchased\" each period, it uses the mortality cost at that age, which tends to increase with age . It is typically cheaper (on whole) if a level premium term was bought with the final coverage from the very beginning. Tip Typically, any change to the benefit level made post-inception requires the insured to go through medical underwriting. However, an increasing benefit plan guarantees the increase, without the need for medical underwriting. Decreasing benefits are suited for individuals with financial obligations that are expected to decrease over time: Loan balance decreases over time with each payment Children increasingly earn more income as they enter the workforce, reducing their dependency on parents Note In Singapore, Mortgage Insurance is compulsory when purchasing a HDB, known as the Home Protection Scheme . Return of Premium \u00b6 Term plans can also offer a Return of Premium (ROP), where upon lapsing or expiration the policy, the insured is returned the total amount of premiums paid till that point , hence \"returning\" the premium paid back to them. The feature is typically only available after a specified duration in-force. This feature is used to attract customers who view term insurance as a waste as they will not receive any benefit should the insured outlive the policy term. The feature essentially provides a capital guarantee on their purchase. It also helps in the retention of policyholders as they is no risk if they pay premiums; the premium will be returned to them. Warning From an ROI perspective, a ROP feature is actually loss to the policyholder as they could have earned interest on the amount had they not paid the premiums in first place. Guaranteed Convertability \u00b6 Term plans can also offer the option to convert the term policy into any type of whole life policy within a specified time frame. The conversion is guaranteed, regardless of the health of the insured at the time of conversion. Note If the resulting whole life plan has lower coverage than the existing term plan, the term plan will continue to be in-force with the difference in coverage. In this scenario, it is known as a Partial Conversion . This ensures no loss of coverage during the conversion process. It is typically meant for insureds who wanted to purchase a whole life policy but could not afford to do so at the time. It could also be purchased by insureds who are unsure of their future financial obligations , thus would like the option to be able ti convert. Convertibility tends to lead to adverse selection as insureds who are healthy have the ability to purchase a potentially cheaper whole life policy from the market . As a result, some insurers might offer incentives for these healthy individuals to convert, similar to re-entry. Guaranteed Issuance/Insurability \u00b6 Insurers also typically offer Guaranteed Issue policies which do NOT require medical underwriting, allowing any individual regardless of their health status to obtain coverage. However, there are typically restrictions such as lower coverage limits or waiting periods. It is typically meant for insureds who have pre-existing medical conditions that would otherwise be denied coverage. These plans have already priced in the likely higher mortality thus are more expensive than an otherwise non-guaranteed plan with identical coverage. Note GIO is applicable to all forms of life insurance, not just term life. Investment policies may be issued on a guaranteed basis as their benefits are not sensitive to the life of the insured. Guaranteed Issuance could also refer to a feature which allows the policyholder to increase the coverage of the plan or purchase a new life insurance plan without medical underwriting when certain key life events occur (EG. Marriage, Child birth, Child Schooling). It is meant for insureds who are unsure of their future financial obligations , allowing them to add coverage as and when these milestones that typically increase financial obligations occur.","title":"Term Life"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/0_TERM_LIFE/#term-life-insurance","text":"","title":"Term Life Insurance"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/0_TERM_LIFE/#overview","text":"The most basic type of life insurance is known as Term Insurance .

It is, after all, a product \u2018for life\u2019. This means that it should be priced on a long-term and sustainable basis. Yet, we currently see life insurers offering big upfront price discounts to make life insurance look cheap. This ignores the enduring nature of life insurance. It is an ongoing contract that must be paid for year after year in order to continue cover. After the initial discount has exhausted comes the \u201csticker shock\u201d to the client when the real cost of the policy appears in years two, three or four. For those clients whose health or other circumstances have changed, it may then be too late to move to another insurer. Such purchases, based on a discounted year one price, are often not in the client\u2019s best long-term interests. So, what do we mean by \u2018sustainable pricing\u2019? There are a number of issues that undermine sustainable pricing. The first is the practice of cross-subsidisation, where an insurer increases prices on other products or books of business in order to artificially reduce the price of another product (for example, income protection) as it is the more popular cover when advisers are designing a package of insurance for their clients. As insurers are directed to disentangle these types of subsidies, we expect more pain for advisers and their customers as prices go up, products are redesigned with reduced benefits, or both. APRA recently wrote to all life insurers outlining their requirements for the future state of income protection (APRA letter \u2018Thematic Review of Individual Disability Income Insurance \u2013 Phase Two\u2019 2 May) clearly articulating a concern with the current pricing and cross-subsidisation practices across the industry. APRA is now directing insurers to price sustainably or face regulatory consequences. The second connected (and intertwined) issue is heavy initial discounts, which, while initially appearing very attractive, are gradually removed over time. There are a number of issues with insurers providing heavy upfront discounts. These issues impact both customers and advisers. Upfront discounts hurt advisers. Advisers have told us that earnings don\u2019t align with the workload carried out for their client when they provide advice at the start of the relationship. Even though a discounted product enables an easier upfront sale, these products don\u2019t help build long-term relationships with customers as advisers are the ones who have to deliver the bad news when discounts expire. If insurers use initial discounts to try and lock customers into a \u2018set and forget\u2019 mentality (and ultimately to claw back the discount with large step increases), this erodes the trust of advisers in the eyes of the community and their customers. Upfront discounts hurt customers. Upfront discounts encourage customers to switch providers every few years to chase further discounts. The impact of this for customers is that they may end up paying more over the life of a policy as they age and are re-costed for coverage and health problems that arise after a policy is issued, which makes it harder for the client to find a new policy with the same pricing and benefits. Short-term offers or incentives create a poor experience for customers as they go through premium \u2018sticker shock\u2019 when the true price becomes evident around years three to four after re-costing for coverage has been undertaken. In the end this penalises loyal customers so the insurer can attract new customers. One of the benefits of being a new entrant to the industry is that we\u2019ve been able to ensure cover is priced individually and sustainably. We hope that our 8 per cent discount for the lifetime of a policy across lump sum products (life, critical illness and TPD) shows the industry what sustainability looks like while helping advisers in selling life insurance the way it was designed to be sold. We also believe this will enable advisers to have better conversations with their customers and create better lifetime outcomes for their clients \u2013 all of which strongly aligns with \u201cclient\u2019s best interests\u201d.","title":"100 PRICING"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/1_WHOLE_LIFE/","text":"Whole Life \u00b6 Nonforfeiture Options \u00b6 All permanent insurance contracts have a non-forfeiture clause which states that the insured will not forfeit the value of the policy when the policy is terminated (unlike in Term), which is why they build up cash values to provide an alternative form of value in the policy. Although it is called Cash Value, receiving the amount in cash is not the only way the value can be passed on to the policyholder. Another option is that the amount is used as a Single Premium to purchase a Paid Up permanent insurance, usually with reduced coverage than the original. This converts the policy into a paid up one with reduced coverage, known as Reduced Paid Up (RPU) Insurance . Similarly, the amount can be used as a Single premium to purchase a paid up Term Insurance with the same coverage with a policy period for as long as the cash value can purchase. This extends the coverage of the insured via a term policy, which is why it is known as Extended Term Insurance . If the policyholder lapses the policy, one of the three options will be applied automatically, depending on what the insured specifies beforehand. Loans and Withdrawals \u00b6 Another way to access the cash value of the policy is through a Partial Withdrawal or Loan . The insured can withdraw a portion of their cash value, much like withdrawing funds from a bank account. However, any withdrawal will also lower death benefit by the same amount. This is to prevent the insured from receiving more than the coverage of the policy. For instance, assume that the death benefit was 100 and 50 was withdrawn. When the insured dies, they will receive 100 on top of the 50 they already took out, more than the coverage of the policy by the withdrawal amount. The insurer may also limit the withdrawals per year and/or charge an additional withdrawal fee (on top of the surrender charge, if any). Note that it is called a Partial withdrawal because a \"Full\" withdrawal of the cash value is equivalent to a surrendering the policy. In the same light, it can also be referred to as a Partial Surrender of the policy. Alternatively, the insured can take a Loan from the policy, much like taking a loan from any other financial instituition. Loans can be repaid at any time but the outstanding balance each period earns interest, usually at a rate equal to the rate credited to the cash value. Unlike a withdrawal, it does not immediately reduce the death/surrender benefit of the policy. However, the policy benefits will be used as collateral for the loan - if the insured does not repay the loan balance by the time the policy makes a payout, then the loan balance will be deducted from the benefits. Note that if the outstanding balance of the loan exceeds the Cash Value of the policy, the insured has a grace Pperiod to make loan repayments, otherwise the policy will Lapse . Most policies also contain an Automatic Premium Loan (APL) feature - whereby if the insured has not paid their premiums by the end of the grace period, the policy will automatically take a loan against the cash value of the policy to pay the premium and keep the policy in force. Note that the surrender benefit must be smaller than the death benefit , otherwise there would be no reason for the insured to keep the policy as they would earn more by surrendering it. Whole life insurance can provide a foundation to allow the household to spend more and still be able to provide a bequest, or to increase spending even further by using the cash value as a volatility buffer for the investment portfolio Whole Life \u00b6 Whole Life policies offers permanent coverage for the entire lifetime of the insured. Note Technically speaking, there is an upper limit to the coverage, known as the Maturity Age : It is the age whereby the insurer assumes all individuals will die (EG. Age 120) If the insured survives till this age, then the policy will mature and benefit will be paid out to the insured This is because the product was priced based on the expectation that a payout would be made by this age. Thus, it is only fair that the insurer actually makes the payout Since death is inevitable , the insurer will surely make a payout on the policy. Thus, it is suited for individuals who want to leave a bequest for their beneficiaries. Info Since the death payment is guaranteed , the face amount is referred to as the Sum Assured . This is why this type of policy is also known as a Life Assurance . The defining feature of a whole life policy is that it accumulates capital within the policy (similar to a savings account), known as the Cash Value of the policy. It can be accessed partially or in full via withdrawals, loans or a full surrender of the policy. The intended purpose of cash values was to create a comprehensive financial product with both an insurance and savings component , reducing the need to get each individually.

Investors will pay more than the surrender value because the policy has greater value if it is kept in force than if it is terminated early. Endowment Insurance is a Savings Oriented permanent insurance policy but with a limited policy period , similar to term insurance. As its name suggests, the primary goal of Endowment Insurance is for the policy to Endow and provide a payout to the insured, which is why the policy period is limited. They are typically participating policies. To compete with other similar savings products (Fixed Deposit etc), the amount paid into the policy must be at least the amount paid out, providing a Capital Guarantee . Thus, the SA of the policy is the Savings Goal chosen by the insured and is usually equal to the sum of all premiums paid over the life of the policy . The savings goal is the amount the insured wishes to save . Thus, the premiums paid over the life of the policy must be equal to this amount, akin to saving in a bank account to meet a target. Unlike other policies, the death benefit is NOT equal to the SA. The death benefit is usually some function (~105%) of the total premiums paid up till that point , providing a capital guarantee as well. The maturity benefit of the policy is usually the sum of the SA and participating dividends . The \"interest\" earned on the product is largely dependent on the performance of the participating fund. Endowment \u00b6 Endowment Insurance offers coverage for a fixed period but also has a cash value component. It is intended to be a saving oriented product with limited insurance coverage. The intended goal is for the policy to mature and payout the maturity benefit, which can be used to fund specific financial goals at known points in time such as funding education expenses or purchasing a home.

As such, they are also commonly referred to as a \"With-Profits\" policy. The premiums from all participating policies are pooled together into a Participating Fund managed by the insurer. The fund is used to support the operations of the policies (expenses and benefits), where the remaining balance is invested with the goal of generating stable long-term returns . Every year, the health of the participating fund is measured based on its ability to support future benefit payments and profit sharing. The excess can be understood as the \"Profit\" of the participating fund, which is shared with policyholders in the form of a Bonus . Bonuses are often referred to as Non-Guaranteed benefits as the performance of the participating fund is not guaranteed. The key selling point of a participating policy is that there are limited downside risks : Guaranteed benefits will be received regardless of the performance of the par fund Declared bonuses are guaranteed and will be received regardless of the future performance of the par fund Bonus declaration can only be positive; losses are NOT shared Guaranteed & Non-Guaranteed Elements \u00b6 Non-Guaranteed Elements (NGE) are benefits or charges in the policy that are not fixed and can thus be changed at the discretion of the insurer , depending on expectations about future experience . For instance, the credited interest rate and expenses are typically non-guaranteed elements as they depend on market conditions at the time. However, insurers also provide Guaranteed Elements in the policy to limit the variance of the NGE. This comes in the form of guaranteed minimum benefits or maximum charges for the non-guaranteed elements. The insurer has the discretion to change the NGE within the bounds of their guarantees. These non-guaranteed elements allows the insured to share the experience of the insurer, which may allow them to be better off compared to an otherwise all guaranteed policy. Policyholder Reasonable Expectation \u00b6 Projecting the maximum illustrated assumed interest rates (generally, 12%), using current (or assumed) administrative expenses and current costs of insurance, without showing the prospective client several other assumed rates of return, creating a Blue Sky problem. The divisible surplus will then be split among all par policies in an equitable way, depending on how much they contributed to the surplus. The mechanics of this split will be covered in the section on In Force Management. Naturally, dividends are a NGE as they are dependent on the past experience of the insurer. Despite being non-guaranteed, insureds often feel cheated if what they receive is significantly different from what was advertised on the policy illustration. While the insurers were not at fault, this has caused reputational issues in the past thus it is in the insurers best interest to payout dividends at a rate close to what was advertised . Insurers accomplish this by smoothing the dividends over time, avoiding large fluctuations. When the surplus is above the advertised rate, the excess may be held back to compensate for potential years where the surplus falls short. A participating policy ( par policy ) is one that participates profit sharing , making them entitled to a portion of the insurers profits, known as Dividends/Bonus . The proportion of profits that must be distributed is known as the Divisible Surplus , which is dependent on regulation. In Singapore, the ratio is 9:1 - for every $9 given to insureds, the insurer is able to take $1 as profit. The Dividend can then be passed on to the insurer in one of a few ways: Cash - Paid to the policyholder Premium Reduction - Offsets the premiums for the period/future periods Accumulate at Interest - Held with the insurer and earns compound interest; value is added to the benefit of the policy Purchase Paid Up Additions (PUA) - Used as a single premium to purchase as much paid up permanent insurance as it can, adding to the overall coverage of the policy; PUAs can be par, allowing them to earn additional dividends In Singapore, most dividends accumulate at interest with the insurer. It usually comes in two components: Reversionary Bonus (RB) - Credited annually to the insured at a rate based on the SA of the policy. Most policies also allow it to compound; allowing previously earned bonuses to earn interest as well. Terminal Bonus (TB) - Residual surplus left after all reversionary bonuses have been paid. It is paid out as a lump sum when the policy terminates, on top of the Death/Surrender/Maturity benefit as a percentage of the SA. The amount of any terminal bonus payable depends on how long you have had your policy percentage of the accumulated reversionary bonus Most non-par policies contain other NGEs apart from dividends, thus there is no need to purchase a par policy to share the experience of the insurer. Dividends are just an additional layer of NGEs that can be opted into. Par fund management BSR = Bonus Supported Rate Investment Return needed to support the current bonus assumptions Compare against the current BEIR assumption to determine if the bonus rate is sustainable Usually within some limit (+-1) of the BEIR is reasonable, no need to change BSR is used to drive Bonus related decisions Singapore is very relaxed in terms of bonus regulations > Companies given a lot of leeway on what to do (Ofher regulations may prescribed more rules or actions needed) SG generally has two extreme ends 1 Don\u2019t react approach (over smoothing) - Idea is that there is economic cycle (Go up will eventually go down) - During times of up save the difference so that can pay out in times of bad - Good because stable - Risk is that there is a prolonged period of bad times, exhausts previous savings and causing a problem 2 Active approach - Raise and cut bonus based on the economic cycle - Risk is customer backlash due to constant fluctuation - Good because no risk of eating losses like the over conservative approach Another question is the scope of policies to cut - You can cut the whole portfolio or a subset of the portfolio (EG Maturing policies) If you make medium size changes each year, then year on year the movement is relatively small But if make small changes each year only, then if shit hits the fan will have to make big changes Bonus setting very much an art due to the flexibility PRE is usually benchmarked against what we share with the PH in the prod spec As well as what the other competitors are doing If everyone is having a good year, cannot be that only our company is having a bad year Logic is that given the size of the par fund, there are only so few investment options - there is still a range of outcomes but largely remains the same Bad optics if only we raise or cut, try not to stand out Important to have intel from other companies whether or not they cutting PAR FUND Estate is the portion of the par fund that does not belong to any specific policyholder. Measure of the size of the par fund = Policy Assets Par Fund Attributable to Policyholder = Asset Share Estate = PA - AS MAS does not use the word \u201cestate\u201d in their regulation. Thus, Income also doesn\u2019t use the word estate. The \u201cEstate\u201d is referred to as \u201cBuffer\u201d. MAS doesn\u2019t care whether you have an estate, all they care about is the health of the Par Fund, whether PA > PL. Under SG regulation, no point having an Estate because the only way that Shareholder can extract money from the par fund is via Shareholder Transfer, no other mechanism. Thus, keep Estate also no point - just declare to policyholder. Asset Share is used to determine how much bonus to declare. Thus, some companies will gross up the Asset Share to the Estate amount, effectively zerozing the estate. Other regulations not as strict, allow for withdrawal of some part or all of the estate, which is why it is a concept for them. In SG context, do not confuse with Surplus >> Refers to the surplus account of the par fund Why have estate? 1/ Non Par products written inside par fund, the profits generated from these products will flow to the estate 2/ Imperfection - calculation error/dont pay exactly what they should be getting, slowly built up over time Par fund is designed such that early exit is better for par fund Partial decrement concept Accelerating Par reserve \u2260 Par MCL Par Reserve = PL PL = BEL @ BEIR + PLSHTRAN + PL SHTAX Policy loan cannot be lower than Par BEIR because cannot have subsidise the policy loaners Cash Bonus and RB is competing PAR Reserve for NBEV is PL, not MCL Bonus principle is one year/current year.

The Cost of RB is the PV of the cashflows arising from this bonus declaration Cost of RB = Reserve After Declaration - Reserve Before Declaration Note that once the rb is declared it becomes vested, so COB in subsequent times must reflect this; cannot just take EPV of bonus cashflow Intuitively think in terms of P&L Declare Cash Bonus & TB, immediately hit P&L by that amount Declare RB, hit P&L by the increase in reserve So the Cost of RB declaration is technically lower than the nominal RB amount (unlike CB/TB where they are equal) Ultimately it is fair as the transfer is based on what is truly incurred Death surrender got different proportion of RB/TB, surrender usually less BSR Asset Share as at today = EPV(Future Cashflows only, excl investment income) BSR = IRR (Cashflows) How much investment return I need to exactly sustain future cashflows Asset Share = precious asset share + cashflows + inv income - ph tax Bottom up asset share might not equal to policy assets due to the imperfects in asset share calculation or because got other policy Key idea is that any unallocayed surplus needs to be reallocated to the policies within the same group, so we need to gross up the asset shares Cashflow no reserve no interest no capital etc MCL = Guaranteed only PL = Gtd + Ngtd + SHTRAN rsv+ Tax rsv Policy don\u2019t just need to pay the benefits + bonu, need pay bonus + tax as well Not common to hold PAD for PL, can cut future bonus to offset adverse experience if needed Allowed under SAS L02 Interim RB = Rb to declared at the end of year Accrued RB = Declared RB + Interim Residual profit is sort of your projected estate Whereas your current estate is your current estate Not supposed to have estate Estate belongs to all policyholders Income defends by saying this buffer is temporary In model projection, declared bonus is already the 90 portion Gross and Net Gross > Never minus Net > Minus Usually used in a Tax context Profit minus transfer Difference between Par and Non Par is that the resprof earns interest, and can only take 1/9 Upon becoming paid up, the policy is non par, no need pay premiums anymore Customer like RB cos vested but company prefer TB cos nongtd Transfer is done yearly Total cost of bonus for that year Resets each year Cost of bonus = cost for the company, how much increase in liability did the company do MAS320 Expense allocation to Par Fund must be fair and reasonable Directly related to Par Fund or agents selling par fund Special payments made to a select group of agents cannot be allocated to par fund There are two conditions for Par Fund Solvency: Policy Assets > Policy Liabilities Par FSR > 100% If PAR FSR below 100%, no need to inject capital into the gated par fund, can just reallocate within the SH Fund to more money in the Surplus account Once inject capital into Ring Gated Par fund, will lose money - Whenever capital injected, there is a provision to recover that amount later - For Par Fund, only allowed to recover exactly that amount (lose interest earned on that) Ring Gated Mechanics Par Reserve is the higher of MCL, PA & BEL Usually PA is the highest. Any investment return earned by the Par Fund will flow into PA, which will lead to increase in reserve by the same amount Thus, from P&L perspective no net change on total company level Thus, any change to Par Fund generally wont hit P&L because there is auto-balancing mechanism Main consideration for Par Fund is always will the change impact the ability to pay out bonus \u00bb Require management action etc MAS320 Everyone in the same channel, for things they are paid the same, can charge to par fund But if you favour a certain group, that cannot be charged to par fund Cash bonus is paid BOM Asset Share \u00b6 The asset share is effectively the accumulated of premiums with investment returns less any deductions. The asset share of a policy in force is the share of the insurer's assets attributable to that policy. Here, expenses, interest, mortality and so forth are calculated based on the insurer's experience for similar policies over the period. Asset shares define the notion of how quickly a policy builds policy values (assets) and hence profits. The Asset Share represents the retrospective accumulation of premiums, investment return, claims payments for regular withdrawals and part surrenders, and the charges payable by the policyholder as specified by the policy terms and conditions. Asset share is the value which the company holds till date i.e. the actual deposits in respect of a policy. However, (Prospective) Reserves are something which the company should hold to meet all its liabilities. Asset shares directly depends on what has actually happened in the past (ignoring any smoothing, adjustments) whereas Reserves are something which is based on the assumptions about the future and will largely depend on the actuary's views about the future. Reserves are targetted to meet just the benefit payments over time, so if everything happens as assumed, reserves will be equal to zero at the end of the term whereas the asset share would be greater than zero, the remainder representing the profits to the company. Asset share is the value which the company holds till date i.e. the actual deposits in respect of a policy. However, (Prospective) Reserves are something which the company should hold to meet all its liabilities. Asset share is the value which the company holds till date i.e. the actual deposits in respect of a policy. However, (Prospective) Reserves are something which the company should hold to meet all its liabilities. The payout on WP contracts is often the smoothed asset share. The terminal bonus is effectively the balancing item to achieve this. Given that we are aiming to pay out approximately the asset share, we need to make sure that the regular bonuses aren't too large, ie we don't want the guarantees to be bigger than the asset share at maturity. One way to achieve this is to set regular bonuses equal to the bonus earning capacity (BEC). To calculate the BEC we project the asset share to maturity (today's asset share plus premiums less cost of claims less expenses plus investment return) and equate it to the payout (current guarantees plus future regular bonuses plus an allowance for terminal bonus). The BEC is the rate of regular bonus that ensures equality betwee the projected asset share and the projected benefits. Asset shares are fundamental to the way that with-profits works, but you're right that they are much less useful for without-profits. However, the difference between the asset share and the payout is one way to measure the profit made on the contract. Asset Share is essentially the cumulative actual profits of a policy, retrospectively based on actual experience It can be calculated for all kinds of products, but it is mostly used with Par Products Par Product Crash Course - all Par policies are written inside the Par fund, owned by the policyholders - If the policy assets are larger than liabilities, this is known as Par fund Surplus/Estate - the insurer must declare how much of the Surplus that They want to declare as Bonus - Within the declared amount, the amount must be shared between policyholders and shareholder In a 10:90 split - the amount of Bonus is non-guaranteed each period, but Insurers try NOT to deviate too much from what was advertised (Bonus Smoothing) to avoid customer backlash, as well as for stability - as such, NOT all the Surplus is declared as Bonus, Some of it is held back as a buffer for bad times etc -- Once declared, the bonus is considered guaranteed (\"Vested\"), which increases MCL, risk requirement etc --- Reversionary Asset share has its own set of assumptions - Why? Does it represent actual? No right There are two methods for Asset Share: * Rolling Method: Take the actual AS for the year and roll it one year forward * Backcasted Method: Project the AS for all previous years Income does the backcasted method. Rightfully, it should represent the actual experience for each year. However, only the INV return represents the actual. All other assumptions are as at BE Since Income does not use the actual experience, we will gross up the total asset share to the true asset share amount, that is tracked by FN/other departments. Problem is that they need to know the AS at the product level to set bonuses This gross up/gross down amount is weighted based on the preliminary asset share calculated and distributed to each product. Then that is the final true asset share amount Asset share is the share of the insurer's assets attributable to that policy It is similar to reserve but is different Reserve/Liability represents the amount that the insurer needs to have Asset share represents the amount that the insurer actually has Asset Share should equal to the Policy Assets Estate > Does not belong to any policyholder in the par fund PA-PL > Should be close to each other?

Every year, the health of the participating fund is measured based on its ability to support future benefit payments and profit sharing. The excess can be understood as the \"Profit\" of the participating fund, which is shared with policyholders in the form of a Bonus . Bonuses are often referred to as Non-Guaranteed benefits as the performance of the participating fund is not guaranteed.

However, insurers also provide Guaranteed Elements in the policy to limit the variance of the NGE. This comes in the form of guaranteed minimum benefits or maximum charges for the non-guaranteed elements. The insurer has the discretion to change the NGE within the bounds of their guarantees.

The divisible surplus will then be split among all par policies in an equitable way, depending on how much they contributed to the surplus. The mechanics of this split will be covered in the section on In Force Management. Naturally, dividends are a NGE as they are dependent on the past experience of the insurer. Despite being non-guaranteed, insureds often feel cheated if what they receive is significantly different from what was advertised on the policy illustration. While the insurers were not at fault, this has caused reputational issues in the past thus it is in the insurers best interest to payout dividends at a rate close to what was advertised . Insurers accomplish this by smoothing the dividends over time, avoiding large fluctuations. When the surplus is above the advertised rate, the excess may be held back to compensate for potential years where the surplus falls short. A participating policy ( par policy ) is one that participates profit sharing , making them entitled to a portion of the insurers profits, known as Dividends/Bonus . The proportion of profits that must be distributed is known as the Divisible Surplus , which is dependent on regulation. In Singapore, the ratio is 9:1 - for every $9 given to insureds, the insurer is able to take $1 as profit. The Dividend can then be passed on to the insurer in one of a few ways: Cash - Paid to the policyholder Premium Reduction - Offsets the premiums for the period/future periods Accumulate at Interest - Held with the insurer and earns compound interest; value is added to the benefit of the policy Purchase Paid Up Additions (PUA) - Used as a single premium to purchase as much paid up permanent insurance as it can, adding to the overall coverage of the policy; PUAs can be par, allowing them to earn additional dividends In Singapore, most dividends accumulate at interest with the insurer. It usually comes in two components: Reversionary Bonus (RB) - Credited annually to the insured at a rate based on the SA of the policy. Most policies also allow it to compound; allowing previously earned bonuses to earn interest as well. Terminal Bonus (TB) - Residual surplus left after all reversionary bonuses have been paid. It is paid out as a lump sum when the policy terminates, on top of the Death/Surrender/Maturity benefit as a percentage of the SA. The amount of any terminal bonus payable depends on how long you have had your policy percentage of the accumulated reversionary bonus Most non-par policies contain other NGEs apart from dividends, thus there is no need to purchase a par policy to share the experience of the insurer. Dividends are just an additional layer of NGEs that can be opted into.

The asset share of a policy in force is the share of the insurer's assets attributable to that policy. Here, expenses, interest, mortality and so forth are calculated based on the insurer's experience for similar policies over the period. Asset shares define the notion of how quickly a policy builds policy values (assets) and hence profits. The Asset Share represents the retrospective accumulation of premiums, investment return, claims payments for regular withdrawals and part surrenders, and the charges payable by the policyholder as specified by the policy terms and conditions. Asset share is the value which the company holds till date i.e. the actual deposits in respect of a policy. However, (Prospective) Reserves are something which the company should hold to meet all its liabilities. Asset shares directly depends on what has actually happened in the past (ignoring any smoothing, adjustments) whereas Reserves are something which is based on the assumptions about the future and will largely depend on the actuary's views about the future. Reserves are targetted to meet just the benefit payments over time, so if everything happens as assumed, reserves will be equal to zero at the end of the term whereas the asset share would be greater than zero, the remainder representing the profits to the company.

Asset share is the value which the company holds till date i.e. the actual deposits in respect of a policy. However, (Prospective) Reserves are something which the company should hold to meet all its liabilities. The payout on WP contracts is often the smoothed asset share. The terminal bonus is effectively the balancing item to achieve this. Given that we are aiming to pay out approximately the asset share, we need to make sure that the regular bonuses aren't too large, ie we don't want the guarantees to be bigger than the asset share at maturity. One way to achieve this is to set regular bonuses equal to the bonus earning capacity (BEC). To calculate the BEC we project the asset share to maturity (today's asset share plus premiums less cost of claims less expenses plus investment return) and equate it to the payout (current guarantees plus future regular bonuses plus an allowance for terminal bonus). The BEC is the rate of regular bonus that ensures equality betwee the projected asset share and the projected benefits. Asset shares are fundamental to the way that with-profits works, but you're right that they are much less useful for without-profits. However, the difference between the asset share and the payout is one way to measure the profit made on the contract. Asset Share is essentially the cumulative actual profits of a policy, retrospectively based on actual experience It can be calculated for all kinds of products, but it is mostly used with Par Products Par Product Crash Course - all Par policies are written inside the Par fund, owned by the policyholders - If the policy assets are larger than liabilities, this is known as Par fund Surplus/Estate - the insurer must declare how much of the Surplus that They want to declare as Bonus - Within the declared amount, the amount must be shared between policyholders and shareholder In a 10:90 split - the amount of Bonus is non-guaranteed each period, but Insurers try NOT to deviate too much from what was advertised (Bonus Smoothing) to avoid customer backlash, as well as for stability - as such, NOT all the Surplus is declared as Bonus, Some of it is held back as a buffer for bad times etc -- Once declared, the bonus is considered guaranteed (\"Vested\"), which increases MCL, risk requirement etc --- Reversionary Asset share has its own set of assumptions - Why? Does it represent actual? No right There are two methods for Asset Share: * Rolling Method: Take the actual AS for the year and roll it one year forward * Backcasted Method: Project the AS for all previous years Income does the backcasted method. Rightfully, it should represent the actual experience for each year. However, only the INV return represents the actual. All other assumptions are as at BE Since Income does not use the actual experience, we will gross up the total asset share to the true asset share amount, that is tracked by FN/other departments. Problem is that they need to know the AS at the product level to set bonuses This gross up/gross down amount is weighted based on the preliminary asset share calculated and distributed to each product.

The cost of insurance coverage (and other necessary expenses) are deducted from the account every period. The account value is also the cash value of the policy which can be fully or PARTIALLY withdrawn after an initial period. The policy lapses when the account value is depleted . The interest earned on the account is known as the Crediting Rate , which typically has a minimum floor to ensure the account grows, but consequently also has a maximum ceiling on the returns. The insurer earns the spread of the crediting rate and their actual return on their investments. Traditional UL : Based on the performance of the insurer's investments Indexed UL : Based on the performance of a specified index Variable UL : Based on the performance of a specific mutual fund Note In the case of IUL and VUL, there is also a Participation Rate which defines how closely the crediting rate tracks the specified portfolios. Warning The account is purely notional - the index or mutual fund is not actually purchased under the policy. Universal Life is known for its flexibility as the policyholder can choose how much premium to pay each period as well as adjust their benefit post-inception (subject to underwriting). Given the above, the policyholder can effectively solve for the amount of premiums needed so that the resulting UL plan (assuming actual returns follow expected) mimics another kind of policy (Term, Endowment or WL). Tip It is useful to think of UL as a YRT with an account value, where the cost of the YRT is deducted from the fund. Sum at Risk \u00b6 There are typically two kinds of Universal Life plans: Option A Option B Level death benefit Increasing death benefit Decreasing sum at risk Constant sum at risk The policy will pay out either the death benefit or the account value. Thus, the cash value can be used to fund the death benefit . The shortfall is known as the Sum at Risk (SAR), which is the amount of coverage the insurer provides, which is the basis for the COI charge. Option A universal life is a plan where the sum at risk changes based on the account value. In an ideal scenario where the account value is growing, option A results in a decreasing SAR over time. If the SAR reaches 0, then there is essentially NO insurance coverage provided, thus the policy is no longer considered an insurance contract and hence does not enjoy the typical statutory benefits. Thus, to avoid the above scenario, the death benefit will be automatically increased once the account value catches up to it. The amount that the death benefit is increased is known as the Corridoor . It is defined as a proportion of the account value, typically the minimum amount of SAR that is needed to be considered an insurance contract. Option B universal life is much simpler, where the death benefit is a combination of the account value and the sum assured. The death benefit scales proportionally with the account value, resulting in a constant SAR . Target Premium \u00b6 Since there are no premium requirements, policyholders have a high chance of under-paying the policy, causing it to lapse earlier than expected. Thus, the insurer usually recommends a premium amount that SHOULD keep the policy in-force for a specified number of years. There is no guarantee that the policy will, because of the uncertainty in the crediting rate. Warning UL is often marketed as a \u201cwhole life\u201d product. However, this is misleading because there is no guarantee that the policy will remain in-force for that duration. This is contrary to other products where payment of the premium guarantees the coverage. Consumers who pay the target premium consistently might see their policy lapse and \u201ccheated\u201d by the insurance company as a result. No Lapse Guarantee \u00b6 Premium Financing \u00b6 IUL is the most common variation as the risk is much lower compared to VUL UL is a high net worth focused product. Mainly comes in the form of SP policy Supported heavily by premium financing - bank interest is 2%, UL credited rate is more than 2.0% Policyholder essentially earn the spread High net worth means branding is very important. Rich ppl want good service, good brand name, want to be able to tell ppl that they dropped X in this company etc. Distribution must be able to reach these ppl to sell How does it make sense that interest rate is 2 but credit 2.5? If assets all in the same place, doesn\u2019t make sense, high risk. If have global investment team, earned rate is higher than the borrowing cost Also cos investment could be in non debt assets, earning higher rate than credited Universal life COI is a yearly renewable term, not like WL coi which is fixed No prepayment Investment grow more than COI, free insurance essentially Premium financing borrow from bank buy par product Bundled product means can only buy if u but others From a projection perspective, for P/L Purposes, the Unit fund should have no surplus since it\u2019s owned by the policyholder Surrender Charge is also a deterrence against bank run Need the funds to cover the future shortfall Potentially higher costs - VUL policies may be more expensive than other types of permanent insurance, such as Whole Life and traditional Universal Life. Volatility of cash surrender values, especially at late duration, can cause a \"reverse dollar cost averaging\" effect that results in higher costs of insurance charges. Proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk, but it cannot be completely eliminated. lock your money up in all kinds of strange ways and do not compensate you for the illiquidity. This makes a VL policy potentially more attractive than every other kind of policy. However, this is only true if the return on investments outpace both inflation and the investment return of the insurer. Although equity does earn substantially higher returns over a long period of time, short term deviations are inevitable and the policy value could drop substantially if the investments go bad.","title":"Universal Life"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/4_UNIVERSAL_LIFE/#universal-life-insurance","text":"","title":"Universal Life Insurance"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/4_UNIVERSAL_LIFE/#overview","text":"Universal Life Insurance is a plan where premiums are paid into a notional account that earns interest.

The interest earned on the account is known as the Crediting Rate , which typically has a minimum floor to ensure the account grows, but consequently also has a maximum ceiling on the returns. The insurer earns the spread of the crediting rate and their actual return on their investments. Traditional UL : Based on the performance of the insurer's investments Indexed UL : Based on the performance of a specified index Variable UL : Based on the performance of a specific mutual fund Note In the case of IUL and VUL, there is also a Participation Rate which defines how closely the crediting rate tracks the specified portfolios. Warning The account is purely notional - the index or mutual fund is not actually purchased under the policy. Universal Life is known for its flexibility as the policyholder can choose how much premium to pay each period as well as adjust their benefit post-inception (subject to underwriting). Given the above, the policyholder can effectively solve for the amount of premiums needed so that the resulting UL plan (assuming actual returns follow expected) mimics another kind of policy (Term, Endowment or WL). Tip It is useful to think of UL as a YRT with an account value, where the cost of the YRT is deducted from the fund.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/4_UNIVERSAL_LIFE/#sum-at-risk","text":"There are typically two kinds of Universal Life plans: Option A Option B Level death benefit Increasing death benefit Decreasing sum at risk Constant sum at risk The policy will pay out either the death benefit or the account value. Thus, the cash value can be used to fund the death benefit . The shortfall is known as the Sum at Risk (SAR), which is the amount of coverage the insurer provides, which is the basis for the COI charge. Option A universal life is a plan where the sum at risk changes based on the account value. In an ideal scenario where the account value is growing, option A results in a decreasing SAR over time. If the SAR reaches 0, then there is essentially NO insurance coverage provided, thus the policy is no longer considered an insurance contract and hence does not enjoy the typical statutory benefits. Thus, to avoid the above scenario, the death benefit will be automatically increased once the account value catches up to it. The amount that the death benefit is increased is known as the Corridoor . It is defined as a proportion of the account value, typically the minimum amount of SAR that is needed to be considered an insurance contract. Option B universal life is much simpler, where the death benefit is a combination of the account value and the sum assured. The death benefit scales proportionally with the account value, resulting in a constant SAR .","title":"Sum at Risk"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/4_UNIVERSAL_LIFE/#target-premium","text":"Since there are no premium requirements, policyholders have a high chance of under-paying the policy, causing it to lapse earlier than expected.

This is why they are also commonly referred to as an Investment-Linked Policies (ILP). Each policy has a unit account that stores the purchased units. The account value is the total NAV of the units at the time. The unit account is conceptually similar to the cash account of a UL policy: Premiums are used to purchase units of chosen funds Units are sold to pay off any insurance or expense charges The account value can be accessed via a withdrawal or loan, through the sale of the units at the prevailing NAV. Similarly, if the account value reduces to zero due to poor market conditions, the policy will lapse . There are generally two types of ILPs, which determines how the death benefit is structured: Protection Focused Investment Focused Has sum assured Does NOT have sum assured Higher of account value and sum assured Higher of account value and total premiums paid The key selling point of an ILP is that it is able to generate high returns , allowing it to overcome inflation which has typically plagued the other types of insurance policies. Unlike all other forms of insurance, there are NO investment guarantees . The policyholder bears ALL the investment risk . If the underlying funds perform badly, the account value could decrease and result in a loss for the policyholder. This section will go over commonly found features in unit-linked products. Premium Allocation \u00b6 Premium Allocation refers to what proportion of premiums are used to purchase units . There are two commonly taken approaches, each differing in how the premium is allocated in the first few years of the policy: Front End Loaded Back End Loaded Lesser than 100% allocated Exactly 100% allocated No minimum investment period Has minimum investment period No surrender charge Has surrender charge Info Loading refers to the additional amount added to the pure premium to cover items such as expense, profit, tax etc. The cost of setting up a unit-linked policy is generally higher than an otherwise non-unit linked policy due to all the costs associated with setting up a unit account. As with all other policies, the insurer recovers these costs over time . Thus, the problem lies with policyholders who lapse their policy before the insurer can recover the full cost. This is more pronounced for unit linked policies given the investment nature of the product. In a front-end loaded approach, the insurer recovers the cost beforehand , ensuring that the costs are mostly recovered early on regardless of whether or not the policy is lapsed. \\[ \\text{Allocated Premium(t)} = \\text{Premium(t)} \\cdot \\text{Allocation Rate(t)} \\] In a back-end loaded approach, the insurer will recover the remaining cost only when the insured lapses their policy.

This is becaused it is assumed that the policyholder will not lapse during this period so as to avoid the surrender charge. In both cases, premium allocation rates tend to increase above 100% after a certain period, incentivising the policyholder to retain their policy to get the additional value. The premium allocation schedule is typically non-guaranteed , but most insurers floor the allocation rates at 100%. Info MAS307 mandates that the term \"Premium Allocation Rate\" cannot be used in any communication to policyholders. This is because it implies that the allocated amount will be used to purchase units. However, in reality, the premiums are subject to further charges (as described below). Premium Charges \u00b6 Premium Charges refer to the charges applicable to the purchase of units . The purpose of the charge is to compensate the distributor of the units, akin to a commission fee. They are typically applied in the form of a percentage reduction of the amount of available premium to purcahse units: \\[ \\text{True Premium} = \\text{Premium(t)} \\cdot [1 - \\text{Premium Charge(t)}] \\] More generally, these charges come in one of two forms: Sales Charge : Front end load applied to the transaction volumes Bid-Offer Spread : Difference between bid and offer prices Both items are typically represented as a percentage (EG. 5%). Note Bid Offer Spreads are a general financial concept: Bid Price : Price that fund manager will bid for a unit (Policyholder sell price) Offer Price : Price that the fund manager will offer for a unit (Policyholder buy price) The bid price will always be lower than the offer price, ensuring that there is a spread. This is to ensure that there is profit to be earned to incentivise distributors to trade the units. Top Ups \u00b6 Apart from the normal premium schedule, policyholders can make adhoc top-ups into the policy. Top-ups are subject to premium allocation and premium charges, but may have a different rate compared to Single/Regular premiums. Bonus \u00b6 Welcome Loyalty Welcome Bonus hits the unallocated premium, negative unalloc prem Cost of bonuses Whenever there are charges posted to the policy, it will sell units to cover the charges. On top of the typical insurance related charges, they also contain investment related charges (Fund Management Charges, Expense Ratios etc). Regardless of the investment performance, the insurer will take a fixed spread from the investment. Note that it is often difficult to determine the actual price of the units used for allocations or charges as there is often a delay due to processing. The transaction may only occur a few days later, thus using the unit price then rather than when it was initiated. The death benefit of the policy is the typically the higher of the Account Value or a Capital Guarantee , similar to Endowment Insurance. The NAAR of the policy is the Capital Guarantee less the Account Value.

Similar to TPD, CI insurance can cover out of pocket expenses that are not covered by health insurance : Medical Expenses : Alternative therapies for rare variations of illness Non-Medical Expenses : Cost of transport & accomodation for out of town treatments Warning It is a common misconception that CI insurance is needed to cover the cost of treatment - that should be covered by health insurance. However, due to the ever evolving nature of CI and medical technology, some rare diseases or new treatments might not be covered by health insurance.","title":"Critical Illness Insurance"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/8_CRITICAL_ILLNESS/#waiver-of-premium","text":"","title":"Waiver of Premium"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/99_Singapore_Insurance/","text":"DPS CARESHIELD MEDISHIELD Free Look Period: After purchasing a life insurance policy, you have a 14-day free-look period - starting from the day you receive your policy documents to review the documents carefully.

Finance valuation typically focuses on valuing assets in order to determine an approriate stock price while Actuarial valuation focuses on valuing liabilities to determine the required reserve for the policy. Unlike finance, valuation in insurance is a heavily regulated process with a fixed method of doing so. It is typically done by considering the difference in the present value of the expected cash inflows and outflows (NPV) from the insurer's perpective . Cash Inflows Cash Outflows Premium Insurance benefits & Expenses 1. Singapore Regulation \u00b6 Valuation in Singapore is governed by the Insurance (Valuation and Capital) Regulations 2004 which is part of a larger set of regulations known as the Insurance Act . The methodology for valuation is described in sections 20 and 20A of the 2004 regulation for valuation on a Net (after reinsurance) and Gross (before reinsurance) basis respectively. 1.1 Prescribed Methodology \u00b6 For non-participating policies, Policy Liability = Expected Future Payments (Benefits & Expenses) - Expected Future Receipts + Provision for Adverse Deviation For participating policies, Policy Liability = Expected Future Payments - Expected Future Receipts + Provision for Adverse Deviation + Future Allocations of Bonus/Surplus For unit-linked policies, Policy Liability = Unit Reserves + Non-unit Reserves where Unit Reserves = Value of underlying assets Non Unit Reserve = Expected Future Payments - Expected Future Receipts + Provision for Adverse Deviation Notice that all methods are at least the sum of the Net Expected Payments and Provision for Adverse Deviation . 1.2 Present Value \u00b6 All values in the previous section are the Present Values of the respective cashflows, calculated using the Discounted Cashflow Method . For non-participating and unit-linked policies, the discount rate to use is the Risk Free Rate (RFR), which can be obtained from the government yield curves. RFR is used to discount as these cashflows are guaranteed and thus Risk Free . For participating policies, the discount rate to use is the Best Estimate Investment Return (BEIR), which is calculated by the insurer based on what they expect the assets backing the policy to earn. Since it has non-guaranteed benefits depending on the performance of its underlying assets , we should use return of the underlying assets for discounting. The timing of the cashflows also matters when it comes to discounting. If we assume cashflows occur at the start of the period, they will be discounted slightly less than those that occur at the end. In general, premium , commissions and expenses occur at the start of the period as these cashflows must occur for the policy to remain in force for the remaining of the period. Similarly, maturity cashflows occur at the start as the policy is in force till the end of the policy period (inclusive). All other cashflows are typically assumed to be at the end of the period. 1.3 Expected Value \u00b6 All cashflows in a typical life insurance policy are contingent on the policyholder lapsing, dying or neither during the policy term. As such, we should not consider the absolute value of these cashflows but rather the Expected Values at each period. This is done by multiplying the cashflow by a probability of (not) Lapsing ( Lapse Rate ) and/or Dying ( Mortality Rate ). Additionally, there are some values that we do not know for sure of at the time of valuation such as Expenses or Bonuses as they are dependent on the economic environment at the time. For these cashflows, we make assumptions about how they would by assuming they would be grow based on a certain rate . Thus, the Present Value of the Net Expected Payments is also referred to as the Best Estimate Liability (BEL). This is because the assumptions we use should be our best guess about how the future will play out, which is based on our recent experience of the policyholders. 1.3a Valuation Assumptions \u00b6 Regulators don't generally like negative reserves, as including credit for them reduces the overall reserve amount (so the insurance company has less backing assets) and it is imprudent, as the policyholder in the situation above may realise their position and lapse their policy (so the insurance company never actually receives the positive premiums). Each country has their own set of regulations regarding how reserves should be calculated and how much capital should be held o Insurance (Valuation and Capital) Regulations 2004 o Notice 133 Valuation and Capital Framework for Insurers \u2022 A fully qualified actuary must sign off on the reserves to attest that the reserves have been properly determined in adherence to the relevant guidelines o Remember that the goal is NOT to prevent insurance companies from going insolvent but rather to protect policyholders from the consequences of insolvency 1.4 Provision for Adverse Deviation \u00b6 Calculating liabilities based on BEL alone assumes that our assumptions are 100% correct, which is almost never in practice. If our actual experience is worse than our assumptions, then the reserve for that period will NOT be enough to cover claims in that period, leading to bankruptcy. In order to avoid that scenario, insurers are required to hold some additional capital as a buffer, formally known as Risk Margin or Provision for Adverse Deviation . BEL + PAD is calculated by shocking each of the assumptions used by a PAD factor. Note that the shock applied must result in a worse situation for the insurer (higher reserve). This means that the shock could be an increase or decrease (not strict) as certain assumptions have an ambiguous effect on reserves. For instance, increasing Lapse rates increase both Surrender/Death Benefit (Outflows) & Premiums (Inflows). Thus, there is a need to test which direction to apply the shock. 1.5 Minimum Condition Liability \u00b6 The BEL for participating policies captures both the Guaranteed and Non-Guaranteed benefits. This may not be an \"accurate\" representaton of the liability as the non-guaranteed benefits may not occur at all. Thus, we instead consider ONLY the guaranteed benefits of a participating policy - which forms the lower bound (minimum) of the liability. Similar to before, since only guaranteed benefits are considered, we should use the RFR for discounting. This is also commonly referred to as the Minimum Condition Liability (MCL) of a participating policy. Note that there is no such thing as MCL for a non-participating products as they only have guaranteed benefits - there is no minimum. 2. Modelling \u00b6 Given the large number of policyholders, it is not feasible to manually calculate the liability. Thus, actuarial models are built to automatically calculate the values for us. There are many different types of Life Insurance products, each with their own distinct features. Thus, each type of product needs to have its own model. Similarly, each product has many different policyholders, each with their own unique information - Sex , Age , Premium , Sum Assured etc. These are usually called Model Point data as they are used as inputs into the model. For a single model point, Excel can be easily used to calculate the liability for checking purposes. However, Excel is not suited to repeat calculations for multiple model points (although possible). Most major insurers would use enterprise level software to calculate the liability, such as FIS Prophet or Moody's AXIS . These software have the capability to calculate the liability for multiple model points and multiple products at once. In general, these software accomplish this by considering three sets of inputs: Global Inputs - Assumptions that are constant across ALL models (EG. Discount Rate) Parameter Inputs - Assumtions that are unique to each model (EG. Lapse Rates) Model Point Inputs - Policyholder information 2.1 Modelling VS Valuation \u00b6 Some companies make a clear distinction between the two - Modelling is focused on building and mainting the models, while Valuation is concerned about preparing inputs and intepreting output. Regardless of a split or not, the two functions are heavily intertwined with one another - it is important to know both sides of the process.

Regardless of a split or not, the two functions are heavily intertwined with one another - it is important to know both sides of the process. This is not very easy question to answer, and I'm not great at explaining things but I'll try my best. The two questions tie hand in hand. You are mixing up the \"reserve\" with the \"liability\". The reserve is the present value of future liability minus the present value of assets. For simplicity's sake, I will ignore expenses and profits, so the liability is just the claim payments (outgo) and assets are premium payments (inflow). Another perhaps obvious thing is, a larger (more positive) reserve is \"bad\" for the insurer in the sense that they have to find ways to get more money to pay this off. I tend to think of the reserve = 0 at t = 0 as a pricing philosophy, where you should charge the premium such that it equals the liability, net of expenses and profits. And the 0 reserve at time 0 is a trivial product of this philosophy. For the U-shaped reserve, imagine you are an insurer and you sold a whole life policy to an 18-year-old, and the premium is $P per year until they die, and the policy pays $F when they die. EDIT: I'm wrong. I was wrong because in my example, the good years in the beginning must suggest all the years after that will be equally as bad. (eg. if I gained $50 in first 2 years, then in the rest of the policy life time, I am expected to lose $50 so that at time 0 I break even, ignoring interest). here's the (what I think) correct explanation: Now imagine you sold many policies of the same kind. The early years' future claim payments doesn't decrease a lot, since the policyholder is healthy (claim payments are back-loaded), but the future premiums decrease more or less linearly. This means that the PV(liability)-PV(premiums) will increase in early years. And decrease in later years because the policies's liability decrease per year gets larger and larger. This is perhaps an overly simplistic answer but I hope I got the idea across. For the second part, the reserve pattern with policy duration is hump shaped because the expected present value of the remaining future benefits decrease slowly at early durations ( as the overall probability of claiming under the policy only reduces by a relatively small amount), but increasingly rapidly at later durations ( as the probability of a claim being made under the policy decrease quickly to zero as the end of the term approaches). In contrast, the expected present value of the future premiums declines at an almost linear rate ( assuming level premiums) with increasing policy duration. The reserve = 0 at time 0 is the result in net premium valuation because the net premium is set at the level where PV NP = PV Benefits. Under the real life situation (esp. low interest rate environment), it is possible to have NP capped by the gross premium, and the insurer needs to set up premium deficiency reserve at policy inception. reserve is pv death Ben less pv prem. If pv death Ben is higher than pv prem at the start of the policy, it would be unprofitable. The company can pay for the death benefit that happens in year one, because they sell a hundred policies and take in a hundred premiums in year one, but only one person dies, so they redirect premiums from multiple policies to pay for the one claim in year one. term life has level premiums, but increasing mortality costs. In early years, the excess premium goes to building a reserve. In later years, the reserve is used to pay for death benefits being higher than premiums. This explanation is a bit theoretical, but is fundamentally how it works. This ignores expenses, profits, etc, which add a bit of complexity. Life Insurance & Annuities for Actuaries Life Contingencies Overview As mentioned earlier, Life Insurance is extremely long term \u2013 Actuaries in this field mainly deal with cashflow projections Each policy has a different feature which results in different Per-Policy Cashflows These cashflows are contingent on a certain event happening (Surviving, Death or Lapse). Thus, it is not appropriate to consider the raw cashflows but rather the In-Force (Expected) Cashflows using the Number of Policyholders (NOP) Additionally, these cashflows occur far into the future. Instead of considering their raw values, we consider their present value to properly account for the time value of money Number of Policyholders (NOP) Consider a population of 1000 similar policyholders. We know the following information: Number of Policyholders alive at the start of the period Number of Policyholders who Lapsed during period Number of Policyholders who Died during period Number of Policyholders who Matured during period Number of Policyholders alive at the End of the Period With this information, we can simply multiply the respective cashflows by the number of policyholders that triggered that cashflow: Premium*NOP Alive at period start Death Benefit*NOP Died during period Surrender Benefit *NOP Lapsed during period Maturity Benefit*NOP Mature during period Assuming that the Cashflows for all the policyholders are the same In practice, we typically build models to project one policyholder at a time. Thus, we consider a starting population of 1 This means that subsequent NOP cannot be greater than 1 or smaller than 0 \u2013 like a probability rate. Thus, in-force cashflows are like Expected Cashflows However, we will not know the actual NOP till the period has passed. Thus, we will need to project these NOP by analysing our experience & using Survival Models Experience Studies We need to make several assumptions about the future to make our results more concrete. We typically make assumptions on: Decrements \u2192 Rates that remove the policyholder from the population (Death, Lapse, Maturity) Utilization \u2192 Rates that DO NOT remove the policyholder from the population (Partial Withdrawal, Premium Holiday etc) Other Global Variables \u2192 Interest rates, Expense etc Insurers typically analyse their past data through Experience Studies to obtain assumptions that best reflects their experience to predict the future. The results of these studies represent snapshots in time \u2013 thus periodic reviews must be conducted to fully make use of new experience All of these assumptions pose a risk to the insurer. If our actual experience is worse than what we assumed, then our calculations are insufficient to cover costs etc On the flipside, if our actual experience is better than assumed, this means that our calculations were excessive thus the excess reserves are released as profits Anything can be done in Life Insurance, if we expect it Sales Channel increase lapse Direct channle higher risk because they know their risk better and willingly join the pool Agent lower risk because they go to client High interest rates are great for the industry because most of the industry is in Bonds Investment incoming should be booming if held to maturity Potential issue is disintermediation - if interest rates rise, then products that are crediting low rates will be unexpectedly lapsed (from the company's perspective) lapsed as consumers just go to buy directly from the market with booming rates Companies will need to liquidate their holdings to pay off these lapsers However, since market value of these assets falls, then this will lead to a loss for them Insurance uses ALM so PV of liability and PV of bonds fall together, no impact on existing business New business will be repriced to reflect new environment Insurers focus on asset liability matching rather than pure price When interest rates increase, both the PV of liability and bond price decreases together, thus they offset each other PA Policy Asset PL Policy Liability PPT is premium payment term Cant keep changing assumptions also Experience, adjust credibility plus loading Inflation tough because they represent rising cost but there may be regulations which makes it hard to pass down this cost to consumers Insurance companies take up good debt to reduce the risk charge - no need to hold extra investments and can reduce expenditure, protecting bottom line Survival Models Choose a Valuation date \u2013 Any date after policy inception and before policy maturity Our implicit assumption is that the policyholder is alive at the date \u2013 Thus the NOP on the valuation date is always 1 Using our assumptions about Mortality & Lapse, we can model the NOP: We need to calculate how many people Die or Lapse each period We do this by multiplying the NOP at period start with the probability of Dying or Lapsing WITHIN THAT PERIOD respectively NOP_End=NOP_Start-NOP_Surrender-NOP_Death-NOP_Maturity Naturally, the NOP for a period end is the NOP for the next period start The tricky part is determining the probability of Dying or Lapsing: We usually assume a certain percentage of people Die or Lapse each year However, valuation is typically done in monthly time periods We thus need to adjust the given rates: Both Lapse and Mortality are decrements \u2013 in other words they are discount rates, not interest rates We can convert them using \u2192 (1-Monthly)=(1-Yearly)^(1/12) There is a more theoretically correct method to do this using survival rates, but the result is identical The NOP Death and Lapse dictate the total number of people who die or lapse in a period assuming all else constant. When assuming both together, it becomes complicated: If you already died, then you cannot lapse, vice versa. This means that the NOP of Death and Lapse should be much lower than they are There are theoretical ways to overcome this, but in practice we usually assume that people die first or lapse first, which affects your NOP calculation Policies mature at the start of the period, so the NOP Maturity is simply the starting NOP of the first period after the policy term (IE NOP of last the period in policy term) Mortality Tables Each mortality table typically has two forms \u2013 Select & Ultimate Mortality The Select table is used for new business while Ultimate is used for existing business Select Mortality is LOWER than Ultimate Mortality \u2192 Less likely to die This is because new business has gone through medical underwriting and should be healthier, thus should have lower mortality (All else equal) Once the policy has been in-force for 1-2 years, the policy will then use the Ultimate Mortality table which has a higher mortality (All else equal) Interesting Impact of Decrements Consider a base case of decrements and cashflows If we increase decrements in the early years, then naturally the expected outflow cashflows in the early years will increase as well However, because more policyholders left the pool early on, there will be fewer to leave the pool in the future, causing a decrease in expected outflows in the future Conversely, assuming lower decrements early on will lower expected outflows in the early years while increasing expected outflows in the future Life Pricing \u2013 Goal is to cover the expected losses and achieve some level of profit Main factors to price based on: Gender Age Smoking Status Underwriting Loading Factors like Health Conditions, Foreigners, Occupation etc Life Insurance uses VNB, EV NBS etc Reserve = Claims \u2013 Prem Negative is good, means we are collecting more premium than claims Reserve only affects tge timing of profit Under RBC2, C1 risk charge is 95%VAR (~2SD) Sweet Spot is to hold 90% (~1SD) as PAD Don\u2019t hold too much as PAD because opportunity cost of capital Don\u2019t hold too little because regulator will challenge If set C1 = PAad, its an accounting trick to artificially increase the CAR of the company C1 and Pad are complement of each other EV = Value of In Force \u2013 Adjusted Net Worth Value in force = Future Profits Adjusted Net Worth ARE THE NON VALUABLE items History of EV > Hostile takeovers in the 1900s People unsure how to properly measure profitability Come up with EV as a way to measure the profitability Metric to shareholder since the share price is often not a reliable measure IFRS17 too aligned with the banks and Australian profit thingy GWP > Volume EV > Profitability NBEV > New business NBEV_TU > Minus top up from ILP holders Grwoth oriented metric No point to build a new prophet system Existing systems already use prophet, people know how to use prophet Very hard to break into the market Regulations in insurance exist because an information asymmetry exists between the seller and buyer of insurance products.

Regardless of a split or not, the two functions are heavily intertwined with one another - it is important to know both sides of the process. This is not very easy question to answer, and I'm not great at explaining things but I'll try my best. The two questions tie hand in hand. You are mixing up the \"reserve\" with the \"liability\". The reserve is the present value of future liability minus the present value of assets. For simplicity's sake, I will ignore expenses and profits, so the liability is just the claim payments (outgo) and assets are premium payments (inflow). Another perhaps obvious thing is, a larger (more positive) reserve is \"bad\" for the insurer in the sense that they have to find ways to get more money to pay this off. I tend to think of the reserve = 0 at t = 0 as a pricing philosophy, where you should charge the premium such that it equals the liability, net of expenses and profits. And the 0 reserve at time 0 is a trivial product of this philosophy. For the U-shaped reserve, imagine you are an insurer and you sold a whole life policy to an 18-year-old, and the premium is $P per year until they die, and the policy pays $F when they die. EDIT: I'm wrong. I was wrong because in my example, the good years in the beginning must suggest all the years after that will be equally as bad. (eg. if I gained $50 in first 2 years, then in the rest of the policy life time, I am expected to lose $50 so that at time 0 I break even, ignoring interest). here's the (what I think) correct explanation: Now imagine you sold many policies of the same kind. The early years' future claim payments doesn't decrease a lot, since the policyholder is healthy (claim payments are back-loaded), but the future premiums decrease more or less linearly. This means that the PV(liability)-PV(premiums) will increase in early years. And decrease in later years because the policies's liability decrease per year gets larger and larger. This is perhaps an overly simplistic answer but I hope I got the idea across. For the second part, the reserve pattern with policy duration is hump shaped because the expected present value of the remaining future benefits decrease slowly at early durations ( as the overall probability of claiming under the policy only reduces by a relatively small amount), but increasingly rapidly at later durations ( as the probability of a claim being made under the policy decrease quickly to zero as the end of the term approaches). In contrast, the expected present value of the future premiums declines at an almost linear rate ( assuming level premiums) with increasing policy duration. The reserve = 0 at time 0 is the result in net premium valuation because the net premium is set at the level where PV NP = PV Benefits. Under the real life situation (esp. low interest rate environment), it is possible to have NP capped by the gross premium, and the insurer needs to set up premium deficiency reserve at policy inception. reserve is pv death Ben less pv prem. If pv death Ben is higher than pv prem at the start of the policy, it would be unprofitable. The company can pay for the death benefit that happens in year one, because they sell a hundred policies and take in a hundred premiums in year one, but only one person dies, so they redirect premiums from multiple policies to pay for the one claim in year one. term life has level premiums, but increasing mortality costs. In early years, the excess premium goes to building a reserve. In later years, the reserve is used to pay for death benefits being higher than premiums. This explanation is a bit theoretical, but is fundamentally how it works. This ignores expenses, profits, etc, which add a bit of complexity. Life Insurance & Annuities for Actuaries Life Contingencies Overview As mentioned earlier, Life Insurance is extremely long term \u2013 Actuaries in this field mainly deal with cashflow projections Each policy has a different feature which results in different Per-Policy Cashflows These cashflows are contingent on a certain event happening (Surviving, Death or Lapse). Thus, it is not appropriate to consider the raw cashflows but rather the In-Force (Expected) Cashflows using the Number of Policyholders (NOP) Additionally, these cashflows occur far into the future. Instead of considering their raw values, we consider their present value to properly account for the time value of money Number of Policyholders (NOP) Consider a population of 1000 similar policyholders. We know the following information: Number of Policyholders alive at the start of the period Number of Policyholders who Lapsed during period Number of Policyholders who Died during period Number of Policyholders who Matured during period Number of Policyholders alive at the End of the Period With this information, we can simply multiply the respective cashflows by the number of policyholders that triggered that cashflow: Premium*NOP Alive at period start Death Benefit*NOP Died during period Surrender Benefit *NOP Lapsed during period Maturity Benefit*NOP Mature during period Assuming that the Cashflows for all the policyholders are the same In practice, we typically build models to project one policyholder at a time. Thus, we consider a starting population of 1 This means that subsequent NOP cannot be greater than 1 or smaller than 0 \u2013 like a probability rate. Thus, in-force cashflows are like Expected Cashflows However, we will not know the actual NOP till the period has passed. Thus, we will need to project these NOP by analysing our experience & using Survival Models Experience Studies We need to make several assumptions about the future to make our results more concrete. We typically make assumptions on: Decrements \u2192 Rates that remove the policyholder from the population (Death, Lapse, Maturity) Utilization \u2192 Rates that DO NOT remove the policyholder from the population (Partial Withdrawal, Premium Holiday etc) Other Global Variables \u2192 Interest rates, Expense etc Insurers typically analyse their past data through Experience Studies to obtain assumptions that best reflects their experience to predict the future. The results of these studies represent snapshots in time \u2013 thus periodic reviews must be conducted to fully make use of new experience All of these assumptions pose a risk to the insurer. If our actual experience is worse than what we assumed, then our calculations are insufficient to cover costs etc On the flipside, if our actual experience is better than assumed, this means that our calculations were excessive thus the excess reserves are released as profits Anything can be done in Life Insurance, if we expect it Sales Channel increase lapse Direct channle higher risk because they know their risk better and willingly join the pool Agent lower risk because they go to client High interest rates are great for the industry because most of the industry is in Bonds Investment incoming should be booming if held to maturity Potential issue is disintermediation - if interest rates rise, then products that are crediting low rates will be unexpectedly lapsed (from the company's perspective) lapsed as consumers just go to buy directly from the market with booming rates Companies will need to liquidate their holdings to pay off these lapsers However, since market value of these assets falls, then this will lead to a loss for them Insurance uses ALM so PV of liability and PV of bonds fall together, no impact on existing business New business will be repriced to reflect new environment Insurers focus on asset liability matching rather than pure price When interest rates increase, both the PV of liability and bond price decreases together, thus they offset each other PA Policy Asset PL Policy Liability PPT is premium payment term Cant keep changing assumptions also Experience, adjust credibility plus loading Inflation tough because they represent rising cost but there may be regulations which makes it hard to pass down this cost to consumers Insurance companies take up good debt to reduce the risk charge - no need to hold extra investments and can reduce expenditure, protecting bottom line Survival Models Choose a Valuation date \u2013 Any date after policy inception and before policy maturity Our implicit assumption is that the policyholder is alive at the date \u2013 Thus the NOP on the valuation date is always 1 Using our assumptions about Mortality & Lapse, we can model the NOP: We need to calculate how many people Die or Lapse each period We do this by multiplying the NOP at period start with the probability of Dying or Lapsing WITHIN THAT PERIOD respectively NOP_End=NOP_Start-NOP_Surrender-NOP_Death-NOP_Maturity Naturally, the NOP for a period end is the NOP for the next period start The tricky part is determining the probability of Dying or Lapsing: We usually assume a certain percentage of people Die or Lapse each year However, valuation is typically done in monthly time periods We thus need to adjust the given rates: Both Lapse and Mortality are decrements \u2013 in other words they are discount rates, not interest rates We can convert them using \u2192 (1-Monthly)=(1-Yearly)^(1/12) There is a more theoretically correct method to do this using survival rates, but the result is identical The NOP Death and Lapse dictate the total number of people who die or lapse in a period assuming all else constant. When assuming both together, it becomes complicated: If you already died, then you cannot lapse, vice versa. This means that the NOP of Death and Lapse should be much lower than they are There are theoretical ways to overcome this, but in practice we usually assume that people die first or lapse first, which affects your NOP calculation Policies mature at the start of the period, so the NOP Maturity is simply the starting NOP of the first period after the policy term (IE NOP of last the period in policy term) Mortality Tables Each mortality table typically has two forms \u2013 Select & Ultimate Mortality The Select table is used for new business while Ultimate is used for existing business Select Mortality is LOWER than Ultimate Mortality \u2192 Less likely to die This is because new business has gone through medical underwriting and should be healthier, thus should have lower mortality (All else equal) Once the policy has been in-force for 1-2 years, the policy will then use the Ultimate Mortality table which has a higher mortality (All else equal) Interesting Impact of Decrements Consider a base case of decrements and cashflows If we increase decrements in the early years, then naturally the expected outflow cashflows in the early years will increase as well However, because more policyholders left the pool early on, there will be fewer to leave the pool in the future, causing a decrease in expected outflows in the future Conversely, assuming lower decrements early on will lower expected outflows in the early years while increasing expected outflows in the future Life Pricing \u2013 Goal is to cover the expected losses and achieve some level of profit Main factors to price based on: Gender Age Smoking Status Underwriting Loading Factors like Health Conditions, Foreigners, Occupation etc Life Insurance uses VNB, EV NBS etc Reserve = Claims \u2013 Prem Negative is good, means we are collecting more premium than claims Reserve only affects tge timing of profit Under RBC2, C1 risk charge is 95%VAR (~2SD) Sweet Spot is to hold 90% (~1SD) as PAD Don\u2019t hold too much as PAD because opportunity cost of capital Don\u2019t hold too little because regulator will challenge If set C1 = PAad, its an accounting trick to artificially increase the CAR of the company C1 and Pad are complement of each other EV = Value of In Force \u2013 Adjusted Net Worth Value in force = Future Profits Adjusted Net Worth ARE THE NON VALUABLE items History of EV > Hostile takeovers in the 1900s People unsure how to properly measure profitability Come up with EV as a way to measure the profitability Metric to shareholder since the share price is often not a reliable measure IFRS17 too aligned with the banks and Australian profit thingy GWP > Volume EV > Profitability NBEV > New business NBEV_TU > Minus top up from ILP holders Grwoth oriented metric No point to build a new prophet system Existing systems already use prophet, people know how to use prophet Very hard to break into the market Regulations in insurance exist because an information asymmetry exists between the seller and buyer of insurance products.

Maintain consistency across products 2. Make your code readable by using \"_\" to add a new line, similar to VBA 3. Minimize reading tables. If it is a constant, read once at inception (t=0) then all other time periods refer back to that period. If read quarterly or yearly, same concept -> Read only at that time period then refer back. Reason is because reading is an expensive process computationally, thus avoid looking up too much. 4. If a variable varies by time, add (t) behind the variable to denote it. This makes it more readable 5. You can refer to the variable name as a string using VAR_NAME Prophet table formatting - Consistent number of DPs Hard to see in excel, open in notepad/propview Build things to be modular, but if there is no way to test it then dont build it You cannot ensure that it will be correct, no way to test it. Time dependent Reading time-dependent generic tables in Prophet programming language If a generic table is accessed for each month of the projection it can have a significant impact on performance because of the number of times the table needs to be searched. You should therefore try to limit your use of time-dependent generic tables where possible and you should also try to access them annually rather than monthly. If you use the READ_GENERIC_TABLE function you should use If Then Else statements to reduce the number of times the generic table is read to the minimum. For example, the following formula might be used for UFII_PC so that the generic table is read annually instead of monthly: IF t=0 THEN 0 ELSE IF mult(t-1,12) THEN READ_GENERIC_TABLE(\"TABNAME\",\"Y\",\"VAR_NAME\",CALENDAR_YR) ELSE UFII_PC(t-1) Within Prophet a product is a collection of variables that together represent the desired calculations. A simple product without Rebasing Within Prophet a product is a collection of variables that together represent the desired calculations. Each variable can be defined in a number of ways \u2013 constants, tables, formulas, extended formulas, etc. The definition of a particular variable can reference another variable. When a run is carried out, Prophet analyses all the variables in a product. It determines all the appropriate dependencies between the variables and then organises the variables into building blocks. Together these building blocks form a complete representation of the actuarial model defined individually in each of the variables. Typically a product will contain some variables that have a constant value for all time and others that change with time. Prophet is designed to organise the variables that depend on time into an efficient sequence. Some variables are calculated in an ascending time order, while others are calculated in a descending time order. Some variables will be grouped together so that they are calculated sequentially for each time period. Prophet seeks to eliminate unnecessary calculations but, if required, the time periods for which the variables will be calculated are the maximum projection term. This is from time equal to 0 to time defined by PROJ_TERM_Y * 12, where PROJ_TERM_Y is a mandatory variable in every product. A set of simple calculations such as those required for using the discounted cashflow technique can be represented as follows: A group of variables calculated in an ascending time order. These calculations may represent the projection of cashflows. A group of variables calculated in a descending time order. These calculations may represent the discounting of the projected cashflows. The above calculations will produce the discounted cashflow value at a fixed point in time, typically the first time period calculated. Calculation looping Calculation looping is a process whereby parts of the calculation are repeated several times. In many ways it is similar to the rebasing facility described in the \"Rebasing\" chapter of this manual. However, calculation looping differs from rebasing in the following ways: With calculation looping the parts that are repeated are repeated for the whole of the period of calculation. With rebasing only the projected part of the period of calculation is recalculated in each loop. With calculation looping there is a mechanism to retain some of the values which are calculated in each loop. With rebasing the values which are recalculated in each loop just overwrite the existing values. An example of the use of this facility is included in the Conventional, International and Unit Linked libraries. In the Conventional and International libraries, the indicator MIN_RESERVE2 allows the valuation reserves to be calculated on several different interest rates by using a different interest rate in each loop. This is needed for resilience reserve calculations because the mathematical reserves need to be calculated on an interest rate which depends on the yields on the matching assets. To estimate the effect of a change in the interest rate, it is necessary to calculate the valuation reserves on at least two interest rates. In the Unit Linked library, the sterling reserves for regular premium pensions business are calculated in one loop assuming premiums continue to maturity and in a second loop assuming that premiums cease immediately. NO_CALC function In order to retain values and ensure that they are not overwritten in a subsequent loop, the function NO_CALC is used with the parameter \"C\". Each product has an indicator Each variable has an indicator logic (EG. Is SG_RBC & NTUC_INCOME) Each product has variables based on the indicator tag Problem is: Variable A is under scope Variable A = Variable B + Variable C Both B and C must be under the product as well If not under, the product build will fail at runtime >> Because variable B and/or C are missing Prophet cannot detect this error Explanation: Mini Module within Prophet Similar to VBA > Declare Variables first then can use them later on EX Formula is NOT a function > Does not return any particular variable More like a closure where the variables exist within that scope KEY NOTE (By default) >>>> Extended formulas are NOT t-dependent >>> NOT calculated at every t Need to declare t as a private variable within the extended formula and use a loop to repeat the calculation Usually declared as tt >> Avoid confusion with main t A t-dependent extended formula is similar to normal extended formula except it is re-run for each month of the projection. This effectively makes it t-dependent and allows you to make references to Prophet variables in your extended formula. The following example is based on the Lookup function extended formula example used to lookup premium allocation rates. Since this formula is only run once for each model point the allocation rate is wrong for a product with an increasing premium. >> Includes t PUBLIC > Can be referenced by other variables outside the current EX Formula PRIVATE > Can only be referenced by the current EX Formula Not case sensitive Declare array: 1 NAME(0,0) > Dynamically sized array 2 NAME(2) > Fixed dimension Need to declare variable type Syntax: Variable Assignment uses \":=\" lexical token [(indices)] := If expression is too long, can use another line using \"_\" Avoid having too long lines so that libary comparison tool doesn't screw up Statements: IF THEN ELSEIF ELSE END IF SWITCH CASE CASE ELSE Loopong FOR a to z step 1 Do While, do loop while For Each > Array only Reference public variables in an extended formula in the form of EX_FORMULA_NAME.DECLARED_VARIABLE(Dimension, if any) PRINT TO FILE Write text/number output to a file on the disk drive Open Once > PE Domain Workspace Compartment - affects who can see Workspace Category - Affects how its displayed Different User Type (EG.

Thus, a large portion of life insurance regulations exist to minimize the risk of claim payment defaults. This is done via stringent capital requirements which requires the insurer to minimally maintain a prescribed level of assets over liabilities, which should provide an adequate buffer against unexpected claims. Note that regulations CANNOT completely prevent the failure or default of an insurer without also hindering their operations, thus the regulation does not seek to fully prevent insolvency, but rather to ensure that the insurer can fulfil their financial obligations to policyholders. History \u00b6 From the birth of insurance to the late 20 th century, such regulations involved FIXED capital requirements that were arbitrarily based on the judgment of the regulators at the time. However, such regulations failed to properly account for the differences in risk across insurance companies as all companies had to hold the same amount, regardless of risk profile. Info For instance, regulators could mandate that all insurers had to at least hold 50 million in assets at all times. These regulations worked reasonably well till a large number of insolvency's in the late 20 th century made it clear that it was insufficient for modern life insurance at the time. Thus, there was a push towards Risk Based Capital (RBC) requirements, where each insurer has a DIFFERENT capital requirement, proportionate to their risk profile . Key Mechanics \u00b6 Most jurisdictions have adopted RBC requirements with slight variations. However, they all typically follow a similar structure where they require each insurer to determine a Capital Ratio of their available capital to their required capital (RC). \\[ \\text{Capital Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Available Capital}}{\\text{Required Capital}} \\] The key mechanism is that there will be several prescribed thresholds that if breached, grant the regulators authority to take action against the insurer. There are typically at least two levels: Higher Threshold : If breached, insurer must submit action plan to restore capital Lower Threshold : If breached, regulator will be directly involved in the planning and/or implementation of above plan There could be additional thresholds which even allow the regulator to take control of the company or force the company to transfer its portfolio to another insurer No matter how robust the framework is, no single ratio can give a complete picture of an insurers financial situation. However, it will allow the early identification of weakly capitalized insurers, allowing the corrective action to begin sooner, minimizing the chances of insolvency. Required Capital \u00b6 The key idea of RBC is that insurers should hold capital proportional to the amount of risk they hold. The minimum amount of capital is known as the Required Capital . It typically has the following aspects: There are several risk categories (EG. Insurance Risk, Asset Risk) Within each category, it can be further broken into sub-categories (EG. Mortality Risk, Longevity Risk) RC for each sub-category is calculated as the additional capital needed to cover liability under that particular risk scenario The RC is aggregated within the sub-categories and then among the main categories to account for Covariance to reflect that these risks are unlikely to occur together Note For the calculation of sub-category RC under point 3, it is typically calculated as the increase in liability when the assumption relevant to the risk is shocked . For instance, the mortality risk could be calculated using 20% upward shock to mortality. The amount to shock is typically prescribed by the local regulator, which is typically calibrated at a desired risk level. Most insurers are conservative and hold more reserves than the best-estimate liability. These prudence reserves can be used to contribute towards the required capital. However, since the conservatism assumed is typically less than the prescribed shock , insurers typically need to come up with additional capital to fulfil the required capital. Available Capital \u00b6 The key idea is that not all items on the balance sheet will be available to fulfil policyholder liabilities . There are several key coinsiderations: Capacity : Is the asset available on a going-concern basis, during winding-up or both? Subordination : Does any other stakeholder have a priority claim to the assets? Permanence : Is the asset available perptually or does it have a maturity date? Note On the note of Permanence, an example of an asset with a maturity is a bond that was issued by the insurer to raise funds. The funds raised are available to the insurer, but only till maturity. Most jurisdictions take the following approach to quantify available capital: Assets are split into different tiers and sub-tiers , based on the above considerations Restrictions are placed on the proportion of capital within each tier and between tiers Certain regulatory adjustments may be made to the amount of capital within each tier for other considerations","title":"Risk Based Capital"},{"location":"3_SOLVENCY/0_RISK_BASED_CAPITAL/#risk-based-capital","text":"","title":"Risk Based Capital"},{"location":"3_SOLVENCY/0_RISK_BASED_CAPITAL/#background","text":"Given the long-term nature of life insurance where policy terms typically span over decades, the primary concern of policyholders is whether the insurer will still be operating at the time to make claim payments.

In other words, they want to ensure that insurers are solvent , having more assets than liabilities. This is done by imposing a minimum amount of capital that insurers must hold in order to run the business. Depending on the extent that insurers fall below this minimum threshold, the regulators have the legal authority to require submission of action plans to restore their capital position or to take control of the company. It is a common misconception to think that fulfilling the minimum capital requirements will ensure that solvency of the insurer. The purpose is for the regulators to monitor the performance of insurers and identify weakly capitalized ones , allowing them to take regulatory action to ensure that policyholders receive their promised benefits. In the past, capital requirements were fixed; every insurer was subjected to the same amount. However, this failed to account for differences in the size and risk of the company, which led to many insolvencies in the US during the 1980s. Thus, risk based capital requirements were created, where companies had different capital requirements in proportion to their size and risk . Risk Based Capital 2 (RBC2) \u00b6 In Singapore, solvency is governed through the Risk Based Capital 2 framework, outlined in MAS Notice 133 - Valuation and Capital Framework for Insurers . 1. Solvency Ratios \u00b6 Under RBC2, there are two key ratios that are measured - Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and Fund Solvency Ratio (FSR). Both have the same formula, but measured at different levels. CAR is measured at the company level while FSR is measured at the insurance fund level. \\[ \\text{CAR/FSR} = \\frac{\\text{Financial Resources (FR)}}{\\text{Total Risk Requirement (TRR)}} \\] There are thresholds set by MAS for these two ratios: Prescribed Capital Requirement (PCR) - CAR/FSR > 100% Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR) - CAR/FSR > 50% If the company does not meet the PCR, then they will need to submit an action plan to restore its capital position within a certain timeframe. If the company fails to meet to the MCR, then MAS has the right to revoke their license and impose management actions within the company. In practice, MAS also sets another internal threshold above the PCR, usually around 135% for life insurers. Within the company, the threshold is usually higher, around 170%. 2. Financial Resources \u00b6 Tier 1 Resource Tier 2 Resource Concentration penalty 3. Risk Requirements \u00b6 Risk Requirements (or Risk Charges) are the minimum amount of additional capital (on top of BEL) that must be held by the insurer for taking on risk. It is similar to PAD - it is additional capital that needs to be held to protect against unfavourable outcomes. However, there are two key differences. PAD only considers Insurance related risks and is internally set, while Risk Requirements also considers non-insurance risk and is prescribed . The Total Risk Requirement is the sum of its three components : C1 Risk Requirement - Insurance Risk C2 Risk Requirement - Asset Risk Operational Risk Requirement (ORR) Note that TRR and each individual component is floored at 0 - it will not be negative. There will not be any reduction in required capital below BEL. 3.1 C1 Risk Requirement - Insurance Risk \u00b6 It is based on the risk associated with insurance contracts written by the company. Risk Shock Mortality Risk Longevity Risk Disability Risk Dread Disease Risk Expense Risk Lapse Risk Option Conversion Risk It is unlikely that all these risks happen together at once - thus, there is no need to hold capital for ALL of the risks at once. We consider a diversified risk requirement instead - which will always be smaller than if the original values were added together. The relationship between risks are prescribed in a correlation matrix: \\[ \\begin{align} \\text{Diversified C1} = \\sqrt{Corr_{r,c} * C1_{r} * C1_{c}} \\end{align} \\] 3.1a PAD vs C1 \u00b6 C1 and PAD are very similar as both deal with Insurance Risk and involve shocking the assumptions used. The key difference lies in the assumptions shocked and the magnitude of the shock. PAD = 90% Var ~ 50% of C1 C1 = 99.5 C1 Risk Charge = C1 Requiremtn - Pad 3.2 C2 Risk Charge - Asset Risk \u00b6 It is based on the risk associated with assets held by the company. We can split the risk requirements into two categories - Market and non-market related risks. Similar to C1, we can consider a diversification between the two. The diversification factor is a fixed value of 0.5. \\[ \\begin{align} \\text{Diversified C2} = C2_{misc} + \\sqrt{C2^{2}_{Default} + C2^{2}_{Market} + 0.5 * C2_{Default} * C2_{Default}} \\end{align} \\] Within the market risks, we can also consider a diversification benefit between them. There is a different correlation matrix to use, depending on which interest rate scenario is used. \\[ \\begin{align} C2_{Market} = \\sqrt{Corr_{r,c} * C2_{Market,r} * C2_{Market,c}} \\end{align} \\] 3.3 Operational Risk Requirement \u00b6 Operational risk refers to the risk of loss arising from company operations such as inadequate internal controls or processes, organisational changes or human errors. It is harder to monitor every process within a larger organization, thus the operational risk requirement is calculated based off the size of the firm, measured through either premiums or liabilities of the firm. $ \\ORR_{Premium} = 4\\% * GWP_1 + max(0, 4\\% * (GWP_0 - GGP_1) - 20\\% * GWP_0) \\ORR_{Liabilities} = 0.5\\% * \\text{Gross Liabilities} \\ORR_{Calculated} = Max (ORR_{Premium}, ORR_{Liabilities}) $ GWP stands for Gross Weighted Premium, which is measure of the premium received during a specified period. It is used to account for fluctuations in Single and Limited Pay business, which tends to be sensitive to market conditions. Premium Paying Term Weight Single Pay 10% Limited Pay 10% * Number of Years Regular Pay 100% 3.4 Total Risk Requirement \u00b6 Similar to before, it is unlikely that both C1 and C2 risks occur together, thus we consider a diversified risk requirement instead. \\[ \\text{Diversified C1 and C2} = \\sqrt{C1^{2} + C2^{2}} \\] Similarly, the operational risk requirement should not take up a significant portion (~10%) of the overall requirement. \\[ \\text{ORR} = Min(ORR_{Calculated}, 10\\% * (\\text{Diversified C1 and C2})) \\] Thus, the total Risk Requirement is the sum of all three final components: \\[ \\text{TRR} = (\\text{Diversified C1 and C2}) + \\text{ORR} \\] 4. Discount Rates \u00b6 As with Valuation, Risk Requirements are calculated using risk free rates obtained from government yield curves. Insurance cashflows are extremely long term, thus requiring a risk free rate spanning up to a maximum of 100 years. However, governments typically do not issue such super long lasting bonds. The longest bond issued is around 20 to 30 years long. Even if there was a bond that lasted up to 100 years, it will probably be a rare one-off exception. Thus, there is insufficient liquid data to determine the risk free rate beyond the 20-30 year time horizon. 4.1 Smith Wilson Method \u00b6 The smith-wilson method can thus be used to extrapolate the risk free rate beyond the 20-30 year horizon up till whatever time horizon required. It is based off three key concepts: Last Liquid Point (LLP) - the last period at which liquid government yield curve data is available Ultimate Forward Rate (UFR) - a proxy for the long term economic interest rates Convergence Point - the first period at which the UFR starts The idea is to split the time horizon into three distinct segments: Time Horizon Spot Discount Rates Valuation Date to LLP Government Yield Curve data LLP to Convergence Point Extrapolate from LLP to UFR Convergence Point Onwards Derived based on UFR MAS has prescribed the LLP, Convergence Point and UFR to use for most major currencies: The only parameter that is not prescribed is the Speed of Convergence \\(\\alpha\\) , which controls the rate at which the LLP moves towards the UFR. It is to be chosen in such a way that results in an acceptable level of divergence from the UFR at the convergence point. 4.2 Matching Adjustment & Ill-liquidity Premium \u00b6 Discounting Matching Adjustments If Assets and Liabilities are met, then it means that the assets held are long term Should have higher yield, can increase discount rate and hence decrease PV of liabilities Ill Liquidity premium Long term assets are ill liquid (hard to sell) thus should get higher return than RFR can increase discount rate and hence decrease the PV of liabilities and at the fund/asset level > Because all liabilities are backed by funds (Balance sheet concept) Insurance funds > Overseas Insurance Funds (OIF) vs Singapore Insurance Funds (SIF) Policy type > Par vs non par Asset = Liabilities Current liabilities Surplus ILP/Non par = RFR PAR = ASSET + INv yield The Smith-Wilson method is part of the broader class of curve-fitting techniques. It is designed to fit a term structure of interest rates to observed market data, such as swap rates or government bond yields, and then extrapolate that term structure to longer maturities where market data may be sparse or unavailable The method starts by fitting the term structure to the observed market rates. It ensures that the term structure reproduces these rates accurately at the given maturities. For maturities beyond the available market data, the Smith-Wilson method extrapolates the term structure towards an ultimate forward rate (UFR). The UFR reflects the long-term equilibrium interest rate that the market expects. The extrapolated rates smoothly converge to the UFR as the maturity increases, ensuring a realistic and stable long-term projection. The extrapolation aligns with the prescribed UFR by the MAS, which reflects a long-term stable interest rate. This approach under RBC 2 helps ensure that the valuation of liabilities is robust and reflective of both current and expected future market conditions, thus contributing to the overall financial stability of the insurance sector. Always converge to UFR; LT spot rate is always the same The UFR represents the long-term equilibrium interest rate towards which the extrapolated yield curve is expected to converge. It reflects the long-term expectations of interest rates based on macroeconomic factors. Purpose: The parameter \u03b1 (often referred to as the convergence speed or decay factor) controls the speed at which the yield curve converges to the UFR. Effect: A higher \u03b1 value results in a faster convergence of the yield curve towards the UFR, while a lower \u03b1 value means slower convergence. A high Alpha value will make the yield curve steep at shorter maturities, moving quickly towards the UFR, while a low Alpha value leads to a flatter curve, with the long end of the curve approaching the UFR more gradually. Exponential Decay: Alpha is associated with the exponential decay function in the Smith-Wilson framework. The function typically looks like e\u2212\u03b1te\u2212\u03b1t, where tt is time (or maturity). This decay function influences how much weight the extrapolated curve gives to the UFR as opposed to observed market data. The Matching Adjustment is intended to reduce the artificial volatility in an insurer\u2019s balance sheet by recognizing the additional return that can be earned from holding illiquid assets over long periods, where the insurer's liabilities are also illiquid. It provides a way to reflect the insurer's ability to hold assets to maturity, thereby allowing the valuation of liabilities to more closely align with the expected returns on the corresponding assets. To apply the Matching Adjustment, the insurer must demonstrate that the assets are closely matched to the liabilities in terms of both timing and amount. The cash flows from the assets must closely match the expected cash flows from the insurance liabilities. The Matching Adjustment is calculated as the difference between the yield on the matching assets and a risk-free rate, adjusted for the cost of credit risk (often referred to as the Fundamental Spread). By using the Matching Adjustment, insurers can reduce the present value of their long-term liabilities, which in turn can reduce their capital requirements under the RBC 2 framework. This reflects the lower risk associated with holding matched assets and liabilities.","title":"**Risk Based Capital** (RBC)"},{"location":"3_SOLVENCY/5_Statutory_Reporting/#risk-based-capital-rbc","text":"","title":"Risk Based Capital (RBC)"},{"location":"3_SOLVENCY/5_Statutory_Reporting/#background","text":"The primary objective of insurance regulators is to ensure that insurance companies can fulfil their financial obligations to policyholders.

This resulted in a low valuation of insurance companies and thus a series of unwanted acquisitions in the 1980s. To combat this, Embedded Value (EV) was developed to estimate the long-term profitability of a life insurance policy and thus provide a more accurate view of the company value from a shareholder's perspective . EV is thus a measure of the Shareholder Value of a life insurance company: \\[ \\text{Embedded Value (EV)} = \\text{Adjusted Net Worth (ANW)} + \\text{Value In Force (VIF)} \\\\ \\] EV is often voluntarily disclosed by the company, which can be used for a variety of purposes: Internal : Stock price justification, Incentive compensation External : Mergers & Acquisitions, Comparative Analysis Type of EV \u00b6 The methodology of EV has evolved over time, resulting in three distinct methodologies. Although there is no central governing entity on how it is reported, the industry has adopted the guidelines outlined in: Traditional Embedded Value (TEV): Association of British Insurers (2001) European Embedded Value (EEV): CFO Forum (2004) Market Consistent Embedded Value (MCEV): CFO Forum (2008) TBC to provide high level differences between the types. This note will largely focus on TEV - but the key concepts are largely transferrable to the other approaches. Adjusted Net Worth \u00b6 The first component is known as the Adjusted Net Worth (ANW) of the company. It is the Net Asset Value of the company, based on the book values of the components. However, some adjustments are typically made to it to reflect the true economic value of the company: \\[ \\text{Adjusted Net Worth} = \\text{Assets} - \\text{Liabilities} + \\text{Adjustments} \\] Note The book value of the components are often aligned to the latest published financial report . From an accounting perspective, net assets represent the shareholder's stake in the company. However, most solvency regulations require the company to hold additional capital on top of their reserve, known as the Required Capital (RC). The required capital is still owned by the shareholders but is not distributable as it is necessary by regulation for the company to operate. The remaining distributable portion of net assets is known as the Free Surplus (FS). Cost of Capital \u00b6 Although the required capital is owned by shareholders, it is locked into the company and cannot be immediately used for other purposes. When locked in this way, the capital generates less value to shareholders than it otherwise would have: Shareholders expect to earn the RDR on their capital However, since it is locked into the company, it can only earn an investment return based on the assets that it can be invested in Furthemore, since the investment income is earned by the company, it is subject to tax Info In most regulations, required capital must be held in low risk assets which thus generate low returns . Thus, the above differences creates an opportunity cost for shareholders, known as the Cost of Capital that is reduced from the value of RC: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Cost of Capital(t)} &= \\text{RC} \\cdot \\text{RDR} - \\text{RC} \\cdot \\text{ABC} \\cdot (1 - \\text{Corporate Tax}) \\\\ \\text{PVCoC} &= \\text{PV(Cost of Capital)} \\end{aligned} \\] Required Capital \u00b6 Actual RC not calculated within cashflow projection software because there are non-cashflow related components of RC C1: Insurance related C2: Asset related, Interest Mismatched linked to liabilities, others are not ORR: Non asset related Above is calculated at the fund level Need to replicate in projection software at the product level Done so by using a factor based approach to scale some metric inside the projetion to the RC AMOUNT most will use MCL ILP not suitable to use raw MCL because MCL tends to be 0 - thus another matric to consider is the equity shock Even for components calculated inside projection, need to have factors to diversify it IntMM Based on cashflows, need to do bottoms up approach to get change in liabilities Change in assets provided by a factor overall RC computed by comparing thesse two items Still need to diversify it, factor based Subfund diversification In RBC2 world, there is only par fund and non-par fund, all other cuts are arbitrary When attribute it to the individual funds/products and add up, there will be some problem sum of sqrt(c1^2 + c2^2) not equal to \\sqrt(sum c1^2 + sum c2^2) Need to use a factor to gross up to their reported amount Split at the fund level - products in the fund use the same factors Total assets (RC+MCL) then split into components using SAA, calculate the RC, repeat until equilibrium Value in Force \u00b6 The other component is known as the Value In Force (VIF), which is the present value of future profits from the in-force block of business. Profits in a company can either be reinvested back into the business or distributed to shareholders via dividends. VIF assumes that future profits are entirely distributed to shareholders, thus is counted towards EV. \\[ \\text{VIF} = \\text{PV(Profits)} - \\text{PV(CoC)} \\] Risk Discount Rate \u00b6 Shareholders took on risk to invest in the company. Thus, they require a rate of return higher than the risk free rate (RFR) to reflect the underlying risk of the company. It is commonly referred to as the Risk Discount Rate (RDR). The RDR will be used as the basis for discounting as it represents the minimum return that the shareholder expects. In most jurisdictions, Debt cannot be used to support capital requirements. Thus, the RDR is determined using the Cost of Equity , which is usually determined via the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) or its variants: \\[ \\text{RDR}_\\text{Equity} = \\text{RFR} + \\beta \\cdot (\\text{Market Return} - \\text{RFR}) \\] BEta should reflect underlying risk Industry and geographical location How to choose represrnative companies? Market weight? by what index? Note If Debt is allowed in some capacity, then the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) can be used instead: \\[ \\text{RDR}_\\text{WACC} = \\text{RDR}_\\text{Equity} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{E}{E+D} \\right) + \\text{RDR}_\\text{Debt} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{D}{E+D} \\right) \\] Future Profits \u00b6 An implicit assumption made is that there are future profits that will emerge over the life of the policy. Note This applies to both positive and negative profits. It simply means that the profits will not remain at zero throughout the life of the policy. To understand why profits will emerge, consider the expression for profit: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Profit(t)} &= \\text{Premium(t)} - \\text{Expenses(t)} - \\text{Benefits(t)} \\\\ &+ \\text{Investment Return(t)} - \\text{Increase in Reserve(t)} \\end{aligned} \\] Note Notice the similarities between the above cashflows and the ones used for valuation: Valuation Cashflows : Policy perspective Profit Cashflows : Shareholder perspective (Includes change in reserve and investment return) Prem Exp (Comm, fixed + var, init + ren) Ben (Death, Surr, Mat) - RI Prem (Pay to RI) + RI Rec (Claims that can be ceded to RI) + RI Comm (Paid to the Direct company, to cover the underwriting and acq costs associated with the policy, since the RI themselves did not acquire business) If reserves are calculated on the same basis as the projection, then there will be NO profit as the terms will cancel each other out: Release of reserves to cover the expected** net benefit and expenses; offsetting the net premiums received in the period Increase in reserves due to the unwinding** of discount; offsetting the investment income earned on the same amount Note Unwinding is the reversal of discounting. Consider the following: The discount rate is 10% There is a cashflow of $121 in two years time The present value of this cashflow today is $100 In exactly one year , the present value of the cashflow will be $110. The present value increases because there is one less year of discounting (all else equal). The increase in present value over time is known as the Unwinding for that period. However, most regulations require reserves to be calculated on a more conservative basis to ensure that the reserves are sufficient even if actual experience deviates significantly from expected: BE rates are loaded with risk margins (PAD) Cashflows are discounted at the RFR ; reserves expected to earn ABL rate Thus, a difference in basis between the projection and reserve will cause profit to emerge from the policy: Change of reserves will be different the expected benefits and expenses (net of premiums) Unwinding of reserves will be less than the expected investment income EV is calculated on a best-estimate basis while reserves are calculated on a conservative basis , resulting in emerging profits. In practice, companies must also pay corporate tax on their profits. Thus, Profits After Tax should be considered instead: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Profits after Tax} &= \\text{Profits} - \\text{Corporate Tax} \\\\ \\\\ \\therefore \\text{PVFP} &= \\text{PV(Profits After Tax)} \\end{aligned} \\] Note This is another reason why profits will not be zero - taxes are usually not accounted for in the reserve. Shareholder Profits \u00b6 Based on the above components, EV can be expressed as the following: \\[ \\text{EV} = \\text{FS} + \\text{RC} - \\text{PV(CoC)} + \\text{PV(Profits After Tax)} \\] Rather than calculating the last three components seperately, it can be calculated directly by considering the Profits to Shareholders : \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Profits to Shareholders} &= \\text{Profits After Tax} \\\\ &+ \\text{Investment Income on Capital} \\\\ &+ \\text{Tax on Investment Income} \\\\ &- \\text{Change in RC} \\\\ \\\\ \\therefore \\text{EV} &= \\text{FS} + \\text{PV(Profits to Shareholders)} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] The key is to understand that similar to PAD, the RC is not needed to support the policy benefits. Thus, it will gradually be released over the life of the policy. The value of the RC is thus captured via the PV(Change in RC) component. Since it is released over time, the RC is also expected to grow : Expected to grow by the RDR but only earns the post-tax ABC Grows by the post-tax ABC but discounted by the higher RDR PV of the RC decreases below its original value - difference is the Cost of Capital Thus, the CoC can be quantified in a different manner as the difference in the two profits: \\[ \\text{PV(CoC)} = \\text{PV(Profits to Shareholders)} - \\text{PV(Profits After Tax)} \\] Par Products \u00b6 Due to the unique properties of the participating fund, EV is calculated in a different manner: There is no CoC (VIF = PVFP) ANW is replaced by Estate Profits are recognized differently \\[ \\text{EV} = \\text{Estate} + \\text{PVFP} \\] Specific details on par fund management can be found in its respective set of notes. For this section, it is sufficient to understand the following: Par Fund assets are strictly ring-fenced from the rest of the company Net assets of the fund is known as the Surplus of the fund from which bonuses are paid An additional amount up to 1/9 th of the bonus declared can be transferred to shareholders into a Surplus Account within the par fund Transfer + Res prof Transfer is the yearly trasfers based on current bonus rate However, the current bonus rate may not fully exhaust the profit > Will have some spare profit > Residual Profit No coC because assumed that it is self sustaining, shareholders do not need to set up capital for it Link to NB strain Analysis of Movement \u00b6 The most important aspect of EV is not the value at any particular time, but rather how it changes from one period to another (usually one year). The process of breaking down the changes in EV into different Attributions is known as the Analysis of Movement (AoM): The AoM is often more important than the actual EV itself, as it provides actionable management information : Identifies key drivers of value Identifies areas for assumption review There are many ways of decomposing the movement that may be unique to each company's business profile. This section aims to cover the main attributions that will be part of every AoM: ANW PV(Profits) PV(CoC) EV Opening \\(A\\) \\(B\\) \\(C\\) \\(A+B+C\\) Attribution 1 Attribution 2 ... Ending \\(X\\) \\(Y\\) \\(Z\\) \\(X+Y+Z\\) Note The impact to PV(Profits) and PV(CoC) is straightforward as they are directly calculated in the projection. For ANW, consider its definition: \\[ \\text{ANW} = \\text{Assets} - \\text{Liabilities} \\] Assuming that there Stepwise Approach \u00b6 There are two methods to attribute the movements: Independent : Changes made in isolation ; model resets after each component Stepwise : Changes made incrementally ; model does not reset Generally, the stepwise approach is better as it accounts for interdependencies , allowing for the correlation among components to be reflected. Starting from the previous result, only one component is added on at a time incrementally to determine the impact of that component, till the final result is reached. If the attribution from one step to another is large, external analysis performed outside the model to further explain the impact. Different sequencing of components will lead to a slightly different attribution for each component as it affects where the correlation impacts are parked under - overall movement remains unchanged. Thus, a sequence that is operationally easier to execute is often chosen. Model Changes \u00b6 Over the year, the model used for projection will naturally be updated with new methodologies or to correct errors, naturally leading to some small variation in results. Similarly, assumptions would have been reviewed and updated based on the latest experience, resulting in some impact to the results, all else equal. It is usually broken down into several minor steps for each type of assumption changed: Mortality, Morbidity & Lapse Commission & Expense Investment Return on assets/funds Discount Rate Risk Free Rate & Exchange Rate Expected Return from Existing Policies \u00b6 When moving from one year to another, there are a few items we expect to change. Firstly, is the transfer of profits . Based on the opening position, the company expected to earn some profit in the first year of projection. Now that the year has passed, the company expects to realize these profits and thus they should no longer be classified under PV(Profits) but instead transferred to ANW . Note This is a reclassification from \"future earning\" (PVFP) to \"earned\" (ANW). The impact on both should be equal and opposite , resulting in no change to total EV. Secondly, is the unwinding of the interest. Moving one year into the future, we expect our assets and liabilities to grow: Assets Liabilities Earn one year of interest Discounted one year less Roll-forward using BEIR Roll-forward using RDR ANW PV(Profits) & PV(CoC) Warning An easy way to quantify this impact is to take the difference between: Opening Projection (t=0) Opening Projection (t=12) However, the first component contains the first year cashflows as well. Thus, that should be removed to ensure that the difference contains the impact purely due to the unwinding AND to ensure that there is no double counting with the transfer of profit. Expected Return from New Business \u00b6 New Business written over the year becomes part of the in-force block and is thus under the scope of EV . The EV generated from the block of new business is known as the Value New Business (VNB). Details about how VNB is computed can be found under its respective section. For the purposes of AoM, it is sufficient to know that regardless of when the business was written in the year, it is commonly treated as being just incepted on the valuation date (Duration In Force = 0). An implication of this is that the entire EV of the business is parked under PV(Profits) , when it should not be: Upon inception, the entire policy EV is captured under the PV(Profits) and PV(CoC) After one month, one month's worth of profits should be transferred from PV(Profits) to ANW Similarly, there is unwinding of the monthly earned interest and discount rate Note For instance, consider a policy incepted in September . At the end of the year , the policy should have: 3 months of expected profits earned in ANW 9 months of future profits in PV(Profits) and PV(CoC) 3 months of unwinding Notice that this is the same process as what was done for the existing in-force block, just at a monthly level rather than yearly. At this point, all the expected changes in EV have been covered. Thus, the remaining change represents unexpected changes that require further investigation . Experience Variance \u00b6 The most common approach taken to explain the difference is to compare actual experience with expected . This attribution is often referred to as Experience Variance . Due to the sheer number of assumptions made in the model, only a few critical assumptions are analyzed. Among them, they are typically broken down into the following components to provide greater insight: Economic Non Economic Out of management control Within management control Little can be done Action can be taken EG. Risk Free Rate EG. Expense For non-decrement related assumptions (EG. Expense or Investment Income), the variance can be determined as: \\[ \\text{Variance} = \\text{Reported Value in P&L} - \\text{Expected value in projection} \\] This variance is attributed entirely to ANW becuase it is concerning cashflows that have already occurred. However, for decrement assumptions (EG. Lapse and Mortality), there are two effects : Current Year : Paying more death benefit than expected Future Years : Fewer policies in-force in future years (Impact to Reserves & Future Profits) The current year effect is determined in the same way as the non-decrement assumptions - comparing what was actually paid against what was expected. The future year effect is complicated because it is hard to isolate the effect that multiple Multiple decrement, hard to isolate the effect from just lapse/death Capital Movements \u00b6 Any changes in capital over the year will affect EV: Dividends : Paid using free surplus; reduces ANW accordingly Capital Injections : Added into required capital; increases VIF accordingly Unexplained Movement \u00b6 Any remaining amount of EV movement that is not captured by the above attributions is referred to as the unexplained movement . It is expected that there will be some degree of unexplained movements as not all variances can be captured. That said, the unexplained movement should only form a small proportion of overall movement. HOWEVER, investment return on Assets backing liabilities DO NOT COUNT TOWARDS SHAREHOLDER VALUE this is because the investment return on this item is expected to support the policyholder onligation (sINCE BEL is discounted liabilities, expected earning rate is already accounted) Value New Business \u00b6 No real reason to model NBEV correctly because there is no incentive to do so since the total VIF remains the same Operating Profit \u00b6 Annual Premium Equivalent \u00b6 Annual Premium Equivalent (APE) is used a measure of sales for a block of policies, typically used as a measure of new business sales. Due to the different types of premium modes available (Regular, Limited & Single), the magnitude of the premium cannot be taken at face value . Thus, APE aims to standardize each premium to an equivalent regular premium amount so that they can be aggregated together. It assumes that a standard life insurance policy has a 10 year premium term - Single and regular premiums are thus scaled linearly to match this 10 year term: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{APE} &= \\text{Premium} \\cdot \\frac{Premium Term}{10} \\\\ \\\\ \\text{Total APE} &= \\text{Regular Premium} \\\\ &+ \\text{Limited Premium} \\cdot \\frac{Premium Term}{10} \\\\ &+ \\text{Single Premium} \\cdot 10% \\end{aligned} \\] Info 10% is often directly used in the formula for single premiums since it is fixed that they will only pay one year of premiums - which will always result in a 10% scaling. The above scaling is not perfect - it does not account for the difference in time value of money. However, the difference is often negligible and outweighed by the simplicity of the linear approach. APE is the preferred method of measuring of sales as it takes into account both the: Size of policies Mix of policies between RP, LP & SP New Business Strain \u00b6 Life Insurance policies typically incur a negative profit in the first year it is sold, known as the New Business Strain (NBS). This is due to the premium in the first year being insufficient to cover the high upfront costs of setting up a policy: Selling Expenses Establishing Reserves and Required Capital It is typically expressed as a percentage of the premium received: \\[ \\text{NB Strain} = \\frac{Negative Profit}{Premium} \\] From an accounting perspective, writing new business immediately reduces the solvency of the company as the shortfall is funded from shareholder capital. However, profits will be recovered over time: NBS is important because all companies strive to write more business - thus, it is important to minimize the strain created so that new business can be written more efficiently, without severely impacting solvency. Payback Period \u00b6 The Payback Period is the time taken for the policy to breakeven ; recover its NBS. It is a measure of how fast profit from the policy will emerge. It is deter Internal Rate of Return \u00b6","title":"**Management Reporting**"},{"location":"4_EV/6_Management_Reporting/#management-reporting","text":"Management Reporting This note will largely focus on Embedded Value given its prevalence in the industry.

Starting from the previous result, only one component is added on at a time incrementally to determine the impact of that component, till the final result is reached. If the attribution from one step to another is large, external analysis performed outside the model to further explain the impact. Different sequencing of components will lead to a slightly different attribution for each component as it affects where the correlation impacts are parked under - overall movement remains unchanged. Thus, a sequence that is operationally easier to execute is often chosen.","title":"Stepwise Approach"},{"location":"4_EV/6_Management_Reporting/#model-changes","text":"Over the year, the model used for projection will naturally be updated with new methodologies or to correct errors, naturally leading to some small variation in results.

Firstly, is the transfer of profits . Based on the opening position, the company expected to earn some profit in the first year of projection. Now that the year has passed, the company expects to realize these profits and thus they should no longer be classified under PV(Profits) but instead transferred to ANW . Note This is a reclassification from \"future earning\" (PVFP) to \"earned\" (ANW). The impact on both should be equal and opposite , resulting in no change to total EV. Secondly, is the unwinding of the interest. Moving one year into the future, we expect our assets and liabilities to grow: Assets Liabilities Earn one year of interest Discounted one year less Roll-forward using BEIR Roll-forward using RDR ANW PV(Profits) & PV(CoC) Warning An easy way to quantify this impact is to take the difference between: Opening Projection (t=0) Opening Projection (t=12) However, the first component contains the first year cashflows as well. Thus, that should be removed to ensure that the difference contains the impact purely due to the unwinding AND to ensure that there is no double counting with the transfer of profit.","title":"Expected Return from Existing Policies"},{"location":"4_EV/6_Management_Reporting/#expected-return-from-new-business","text":"New Business written over the year becomes part of the in-force block and is thus under the scope of EV . The EV generated from the block of new business is known as the Value New Business (VNB). Details about how VNB is computed can be found under its respective section. For the purposes of AoM, it is sufficient to know that regardless of when the business was written in the year, it is commonly treated as being just incepted on the valuation date (Duration In Force = 0). An implication of this is that the entire EV of the business is parked under PV(Profits) , when it should not be: Upon inception, the entire policy EV is captured under the PV(Profits) and PV(CoC) After one month, one month's worth of profits should be transferred from PV(Profits) to ANW Similarly, there is unwinding of the monthly earned interest and discount rate Note For instance, consider a policy incepted in September . At the end of the year , the policy should have: 3 months of expected profits earned in ANW 9 months of future profits in PV(Profits) and PV(CoC) 3 months of unwinding Notice that this is the same process as what was done for the existing in-force block, just at a monthly level rather than yearly.

Risk Free Rate EG. Expense For non-decrement related assumptions (EG. Expense or Investment Income), the variance can be determined as: \\[ \\text{Variance} = \\text{Reported Value in P&L} - \\text{Expected value in projection} \\] This variance is attributed entirely to ANW becuase it is concerning cashflows that have already occurred. However, for decrement assumptions (EG. Lapse and Mortality), there are two effects : Current Year : Paying more death benefit than expected Future Years : Fewer policies in-force in future years (Impact to Reserves & Future Profits) The current year effect is determined in the same way as the non-decrement assumptions - comparing what was actually paid against what was expected.

Due to the different types of premium modes available (Regular, Limited & Single), the magnitude of the premium cannot be taken at face value . Thus, APE aims to standardize each premium to an equivalent regular premium amount so that they can be aggregated together. It assumes that a standard life insurance policy has a 10 year premium term - Single and regular premiums are thus scaled linearly to match this 10 year term: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{APE} &= \\text{Premium} \\cdot \\frac{Premium Term}{10} \\\\ \\\\ \\text{Total APE} &= \\text{Regular Premium} \\\\ &+ \\text{Limited Premium} \\cdot \\frac{Premium Term}{10} \\\\ &+ \\text{Single Premium} \\cdot 10% \\end{aligned} \\] Info 10% is often directly used in the formula for single premiums since it is fixed that they will only pay one year of premiums - which will always result in a 10% scaling.

This process is internally known as Business Planning . The financial performance of the company is measured through three metrics, known as Key Peformance Index (KPI): New Business Embedded Value (NBEV) Insurance Operating Results (IOR) Annual Premium Equivalent (APE) Each of the above components have different weightage to the overall financial performance Business Planning comes in a few phases: Baseline : Setting target KPIs for the next three years (~August) Rebase : Adjusting target for the coming year based on the past year's performance (Start of the year) Reforecast : Gauge of whether the KPI for the current year will be hit (Middle of the year, may be more than once) There are three levels to the KPI: Threshold : Lower bound; below this no bonus is paid Budget : Expected amount; beyond this amount the full bonus is paid Stretch : Upper bound of the KPI; beyond this additional bonus (1.3 times) is paid The forecasted values for each of these metrics is known as the Budget amount. During the reforecast process, the Actual amount will be compared against the Budget to determine how \"on track\" the company is from the budget. Through this process, management can determine how well each area is performing in the company. They can then take appropriate action to help bolster areas of the company that are under-performing. Key Performance Index \u00b6 New Business Embedded Value \u00b6 Embedded Value (EV) is a measure of the profitability of a life insurance contract. It is typically measured for ALL in force contracts at the time of calculation. However, New Business EV (NBEV) thus represents the profitability of ONLY newly written business within the year . More details on the computation be found in a seperate note on EV. NBEV is calculated as an absolute value , known as the NBEV Dollar Amount . However, absolute amounts are not very useful when measuring profitability. $10 profit given $100 revenue is much better than $10 profit given $1000 revenue. Thus, it is much better to consider the Profit Margin instead. In this context, it is referred to as the NBEV Margin . It is calculated as the ratio of the NBEV Dollar to the APE, representing the expected profit per dollar of premium collected : $$ $$ Despite this, the NBEV Dollar Amount is used as the KPI, rather than the margin. The NBEV dollar KPI can be determined in two ways: Bottom Up Approach : Put Budget APE into prophet and calculate the NBEV Dollar Top Down Approach : Arbitrarily choose Budget NBEV Margin and multiply by sales to get NBEV Dollar Bottom Up Approach is much better as it is transparent and easily explainable Insurance Operating Results \u00b6 Insurance Operating Results (IOR) is an industry term used to refer to the Operating Profit BEFORE tax.

Each of these components will change in subsequent measurements (typically annually). A portion of the RA will he released into profits, as well as a portion of the CSM. A portion of BEL may also flow into profits, depending on the actual claims, expenses, and premiums recognized during that period. Insurance Revenue under IFRS 17 is defined by: Expected claims + Expected expenses - actual claims - actual expenses + CSM release + RA release. The expected minus actual bit there simply defines deviation grom expectations, which flows directly into P/L. RA release can be defines differently from company to company, but it is typically an amount proportional to the amount of service provided in the period, which could be based off expected or actual claims. For example, if at initial recognition your PV(claims) = $100k and you have an RA of $10k, if you expected $5k of claims to be incurred over the past year, then your RA release would be $0.5k. The CSM release is based on an amortization schedule that is defined at initial onset, and also uses locked in discount rates at initial recognition. Your initial CSM, which is essentially a liability for future profits, and is defined as total profits at time 0, which is ( -[PV(outflows)-PV(inflows)] - RA), is going to be released according to the amortization schedule, which should be defined by the expected amount of service to be provided im a period, which is similar to the RA release. One thing to note here though, is that BEFORE the CSM is released according to the amortization schedule, it is adjusted for several items, like recognition of new contracts in a group, or changes in discount rates. Then the initial percentage defined by the amortization schedule is to be applied to the CSM balance, and released directly into P/L for the period. Hope this helps! And anyone, please correct me if any of this information isn't 100% accurate. Coverage units significantly impact the calculation and allocation of the Contractual Service Margin (CSM) in insurance contracts under IFRS 17. Here\u2019s how: Contractual Service Margin (CSM) The CSM is the unearned profit that an insurer expects to earn from insurance contracts over the coverage period. It ensures that no profit is recognized at the initial recognition of the contract. Coverage Units Coverage units represent the amount of insurance coverage provided during each period. They reflect the expected pattern of release of the CSM over the coverage period. The concept ensures that the CSM is released in a way that aligns with the insurance service provided. Impact on CSM Initial Measurement: \u2022 At initial recognition, the CSM is calculated as the difference between the premiums received (or expected) and the fulfillment cash flows (present value of future cash flows, including claims and expenses). Subsequent Allocation: \u2022 The CSM is systematically recognized in profit or loss over the coverage period using the coverage units. \u2022 Coverage units determine the allocation pattern, ensuring the CSM release corresponds to the insurance service provided. \u2022 This allocation is done by dividing the CSM by the total number of coverage units over the contract\u2019s duration, then recognizing the portion corresponding to the coverage units for the period. Example Assume an insurance contract provides coverage of $1 million in year one, $1.5 million in year two, and $500,000 in year three. The total coverage over the three years is $3 million. Coverage Units: \u2022 Year 1: \u2153 of the total coverage units. \u2022 Year 2: 1.5/3 of the total coverage units. \u2022 Year 3: 0.5/3 of the total coverage units. CSM Allocation: \u2022 If the initial CSM is $900,000, the allocation per year based on coverage units would be: \u2022 Year 1: 900,000 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 300,000 \u2022 Year 2: 900,000 \\times \\frac{1.5}{3} = 450,000 \u2022 Year 3: 900,000 \\times \\frac{0.5}{3} = 150,000 Thus, the CSM is recognized in profit or loss in a manner consistent with the insurance services provided. Summary Coverage units are crucial for the appropriate recognition of the CSM, ensuring it aligns with the service provided over the life of the contract. This systematic allocation helps in reflecting the insurer\u2019s performance and profitability accurately over time. IFRS9 - Asset treatment IFRS17 - Insurance Liability treatment Which is why the first thing 17 does is to distinguish between asset and liability Another problem of current insurance accounting is the \u201cvolatility\u201d in profits Profits early and losses later IFRS17 smooths this by withholding the profit into a B/S item called CSM which sometimes the profit throughout the lifetime of the policy, removing this volatility Conversely if a contract is loss making from the get go, losses are recognized upfront into an item called Loss Component If a contract flips, there will be some reversal on both sides CSM is very different from EV due to different assumptions But mainly due to Teo large components 1 Cost of Reserve 2 Cost of Capital Reserve and Capital earn ABL and ABC respectively, but shareholder want RDR, losing the difference IFRS4 is transparent because almost everything is on a cash basis, only reserve line is not IFRS17 is opaque because of CSM CSM has a crucial concept relating to current or future service Current - Recognize now Future - Capitalize and amortize EG.

To determine if it is significant, we can use one of the following metrics: PV (Ouflows)>PV (Inflows) (PV (Outflows \u2524| Insured event occurs))/PV(Outlowd | Insured event does NOT occur) >103~105% Note that the PV uses the per policy cashflows, NOT the expected ones If the contract does not qualify as a significant insurance risk, then the contract should be accounted for using another financial reporting standard: IFRS 9 \u2013 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 \u2013 Revenue from Contracts Life Insurance General Insurance Event occurs Death; Death Benefit Max(Loss,Limit) Event does not occur Survival; Surrender Benefit 0 Since there are no cashflows under the scenario where the insured event does not occur, General Insurance products typically always pose a significant insurance risk hence no quantitative test is needed Measurement Models General Measurement Model (GMM) \u2192 Non-participating Life Contracts Variable Fee Approach (VFA) \u2192 Participating Life Contracts Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) \u2192 Short-term Contracts Contractual Service Margin (CSM) - Unearned profit the insurer will recognise as it provides insurance contract services in the future IFRS17 introduced contractual service margins Stored value and release abit of it every year to the P/L in accordance to the service provided that year sort of like amortization Any change that affects the future value would affect the CSM while changes that affect the present would affect the current P/L directly What we have collected is already How much Assets that are we related to this business, not just policies, intangible business Potential to sell (Future premiums) Contractual Service margin > Component of the measurement of the insurance contract representing the unearned profit that the entity recognises AS it provides the insurance contract services CSM = PV expectred future inflows \u2013 PV expected future outflows Financial world is all about how you categorize Assets and Liabilities Insurance Metrics Annual Premium Equivalent \u2022 Measure of the new business acquired over a period o 100% of Regular Premium + 10% Single Premium \u2022 Companies internally monitor the growth of APE over time.

We say that the Reinsurer assumes responsibility for part of the loss \u2022 The Reinsurance company can also take up reinsurance to limit exposure to losses, known as Retrocession o Important that Reinsurance companies do not eventually form a circular loop where a reinsurer is reinsuring part of themselves o However, reinsurance may be provided for by another company in the corporate group. In this case, it is known as Captive Reinsurance \u2022 Thus, instead of Retroceding to another Reinsurance Company, they could Retrocede the risk to the Capital Markets instead in the form of Insurance-Linked-Securities (EG. Catastrophe Bonds) \u2022 Unlike regular insurance, one contract could involve several reinsurers at once or multiple reinsurance contracts could be issued to cover one risk (Each taking a different part of it) \u2022 However, the Cedant is not absolved of all risk. Having a reinsurance agreement in place does NOT relieve the obligations of the original insurer to the policyholder. They are reliant on the Reinsurer indemnifying them, thus there is still some level of Credit Risk that the Cedant is exposed to Why Reinsurance? \u2022 Consider from an insurance company\u2019s perspective, why they would want Reinsurance: o Precisely manage their risks. Insurers can choose which risks they want to retain and cede out the portion they don\u2019t want to. This can be beneficially when trying to manoeuvre around regulatory solvency requirements o Stabilize business results. Instead of the potentially having high frequency or large claims, it is replaced with a fixed premium. This makes performance more predictable which could have tax benefits or relaxed capital requirements o Increase underwriting capacity. Since only a portion of the risk is actually assumed by the insurer, they can afford to write risks that would have otherwise been too big. This ensures that most events are insurable at an affordable price o Protect against Catastrophe Losses. Catastrophes often hit an entire region at a time, which would instantly bankrupt an insurer as their risks tend to be concentrated in a particular region. However, Reinsurers operate globally; thus they can afford to reinsurer for Catastrophe Risks \u2022 Reinsurance tends to focus more on the General Insurance side of things given the large risk that they write. However, there are trends in the Life Insurance side as well in the form of Financial Reinsurance Captive Insurance Setting up another insurance company to insure against your own losses Main benefit is mainly capital constraints, tax, funding etc Regulated alternative to self insurance > Less tempted to take the money Offer direct access to reinsurance and act as an investment vehicle The problem with that approach is its lack of a formal structure, creating the temptation to access the funds for other purposes and ambiguity about how much coverage a firm actually has. With a captive, on the other hand, the funds are segregated and held in a regulated, audited vehicle, which can help the firm go out and attain more cover from the reinsurance market. To be clear: the captive would insure only its parent company, not competitors. aid over the years his firm has been quoted insurance many times at prices which were \u201cridiculous and obscene.\u201d If pricing is too high in the commercial insurance markets or no underwriters are willing to cover a firm\u2019s risk, captives are used to formalize self-insurance with reporting on capital and reserve requirements. Captives are typically set up for more niche products (though not always) so I suppose the only disadvantage is if you work on some niche product at a captive and then later that work doesn't translate to other more general career options. > Hard to get priced Introduction to Reinsurance Treaties Based on policy coverage Facultative Treaty Contracts are underwritten on an individual risk basis; the reinsurer has the option to reject each risk Contracts are underwritten for an entire class of business (Similar risk); reinsurer cannot reject any individual risk \u2022 There is a hybrid version known as Facultative Obligatory Treaty \u2013 The Cedant gets to decide which risks within the portfolio they want to Cede, and the Reinsurer cannot reject whatever they choose to cede out \u2022 Most reinsurance contracts are treaties, only a small ~15% are Facultative Based on policy operation Proportional (Pro-Rata) Non-Proportional (Excess of Loss; XL) Quota Share Surplus Per Risk XL (Working XL) Per Event XL (Cat XL) Aggregate XL (Stop Loss) Covers a fixed percentage of the risk Covers ALL surplus over a retention limit Covers losses above the retention limit of the policy, up to the policy limit Covers large losses from multiple policies from a single event (Catastrophe) Covers losses based on overall frequency instead of size Other points \u2022 Reinsurance contracts typically mirror the terms & exclusions of the underlying risk it is insuring \u2022 Since Reinsurance is a contract surrounding two professional entities, the guidelines and regulations are very different compared to primary insurer \u2022 Financial Reinsurance is a very up and coming thing Sum at risk of the reinsurer Calculated at the benefit level for each individual benefit Calculated based on the amount ceded to reinsurer RI Premium = SAR * RI Premium Rate Insurer will clacualte SAR and the corresponding premium, send to Reinsurer to verify and check This is known as the Statement of Account The basis is agreed beforehand with the insurer on how to calcualte SAR Some SAR is complicated because some want/dont want to include SAR, because technically we are holding reserves for the benefits, nothing at risk to the reinsurer Problem is that if this the case, then need to align on the reserving basis with the resinurer, which is hard for both parties to agree All the terms is captured under the Treaty binding agreement","title":"1 Reinsurance Overview"},{"location":"98_HEALTH/1_Health_Products/","text":"Health Insurance Products \u00b6 Health insurance is meant to protect against the financial risk of being afflicted with a temporary or permanent health condition.

Surgery Most people can afford to bear the former from their salary or savings, but few are able to bear the latter - which is the main focus of Health Insurance. Health Insurance Features \u00b6 Cost Sharing Mechanisms \u00b6 There are several cost sharing mechanisms in place: Mechanism Explanation Co-Payment Part of the expense that must be paid by the individual no matter what Deductible Portion of the remaining expense that must be paid by the individual before any insurance benefits Co-Insurance Portion of the remaining expense that must be paid on top of the deductible Claim Limit Maximum amount that the insurance will cover over a period; any excess is paid by the individual Note that Co-payments do NOT count towards the Deductible; hence the word remaining is used. These mechanisms are meant to discourage individuals from choosing expensive providers and discourage them from seeking excessive treatment . This reduces the cost to insurers, allowing them to keep premiums affordable. However, some criticism is that these mechanisms may discourage individuals from seeking seemingly minor treatments, which could possibly snowball into something more serious, resulting in an even larger claim for the insurer (counterproductive). Panel Doctors \u00b6 Health insurance claims are made through healthcare providers rather than from the individual to the insurer. This is so that individuals do not need to fork out a large lump sum of cash for treatment; Healthcare providers will claim against your insurance to recover the cost of treatment instead. Given this arrangement, people will only go to providers where their insurance plan covers them. Insurers prefer lower healthcare costs to manage their costs while healthcare providers want to charge a high cost in order to increase their profits. Insurers want to cover only the lowest cost providers, but needs to have a sufficiently wide coverage for their policyholders. Similarly, healthcare providers want to charge the highest possible cost, but needs to be covered by an insurer for sufficient demand. Thus, insurers typically make a deal with healthcare providers such that they provide cover for them in exchange for lower cost - a balance between the two parties interest. These providers are often known as Network Providers . Most policies provide better coverage for network providers or only cover network providers. Higher premiums may be charged for coverage outside of the insurers network. Singapore Health Insurance System \u00b6 Healthcare is a public sector and as such depends heavily on the socio-political environment of the country. As a result, different countries have different healthcare systems & hence different health insurance landscape. Singapore provides government subsidised public healthcare for all services. Specifically for hospitalization expenses, individuals are put through means testing to determine the level of subsidy provided. The means testing is dependent on the type of ward chosen - only class C and B2 wards are eligible for subsidies. Within these two categories, the final amount is dependent on their monthly income. Medishield Life \u00b6 Singapore has a basic national Medical Expense insurance plan for all Singaporeans and PRs known as Medishield Life . It is automatically paid for from the Medisave account under CPF, who manages the policy. It is designed to partially reimburse basic public healthcare costs , but can also be used to partially reimburse certain private costs as well, capped at what it would have been in the public sector. Individuals can additionally purchase a private health insurance plan that works on top of Medishield, collectively known as an Integrated Shield Plan . Instead of paying two seperate premiums, only one premium needs to be paid to the private insurer, who will pass on the Medishield portion to CPF. Medisave can be used to pay the entire medishield portion, as well as part of the private portion. The integrated plan naturally covers a wider range of health conditions with higher reimbursements. MediFund \u00b6 Singapore's social safety net program is known as MediFund , which covers only the most basic of services. It is provided on a case by case basis, typically when the Medisave account has been depleted. It is by definition, a safety net - meant to catch people who are falling to prevent them from dying, but not meant to return them to where they fell from. It provides a minimum amount of welfare that the government has agreed nobody should fall below. Mental health insurance Introduction to Health Insurance \u2022 The policy also has a unique exclusion \u2013 Pre-existing conditions. Any existing illness or disability at the time of purchase (Known to you or not) will not be covered by the policy. Therefore, it is advised to buy health insurance when you are still young and healthy Types of Health Insurance By Policy Benefits Reimbursements Fixed Benefits Graded Benefits Pays out an amount equal to the cost of healthcare treatment Pays out a fixed amount regardless of the severity of Health Conditions Pays out an amount proportional to the severity of Health Condition By Policy Coverage Medical Expense Insurance Reimburses the policyholder in the event they require medical treatment Hospitalisation Insurance Pays out a fixed benefit to the policyholder for each day they are hospitalized, on top of any existing Medical Expense Claims made Within each type, it can be further broken down by severity but varies according to insurer.
