As its name suggests, it provides an insurance cover ONLY for a specific timeframe , known as the term of the policy. Most insurers offer a term plans till a specified age OR for a specified number of years (usually in multiples of 5 or 10). If the insured event does NOT occur during the policy term, the policy will expire and NO benefits will be paid at all . For this reason, term life insurance has the lowest premiums among other life insurance plan types with similar coverage. Note The most basic term plan is one that only covers Death. It is easy to compare these plans across insurers, which makes it price competitive , which is another reason why it tends to be cheaper. Term plans are best suited for individuals with financial obligations that only last for a limited period of time , such as during a loan repayment or till a child becomes financially independent. Renewability \u00b6 Term plans can offer Guaranteed Renewability . This allows the policyholder to renew the term policy at expiration to provide coverage again for the same duration. It is meant to provide flexibility for insureds with uncertain long-term financial obligations or for those with difficulty affording long-term coverage at the moment. Note Upon renewal, the premiums of the policyholder will increase to reflect the higher mortality due to age and the ultimate mortality . Health tends to deteriorate with age, thus should the insured want to purchase a new policy after the original, they might be rejected or priced out . Guaranteed Renewability overcomes this as it ensures the insured retains their coverage WITHOUT needing to go through medical underwriting. However, such guaranteed renewability features might result in Adverse Selection . Healthy insured may instead choose to go through medical underwriting to purchase a new plan at a potentially lower rate; leaving only unhealthy insureds in the renewed pool. To combat this, some insurers offer a re-entry option that allows policyholders to voluntarily go through medical underwriting upon renewal to obtain lower premiums, incentivizing healthy insured to renew as well. Note It is known as re-entry as the policyholder re-enters the Select Mortality Group upon renewal. Yearly Renewable \u00b6 The most extreme version of renewability is for a plan with a one year term that is guaranteed renewable; typically known as Yearly Renewable Term (YRT). Pure YRTs are often not sold in practice, but serves as a baseline for understanding more complex products. Non-Level Benefits \u00b6 Term plans typically offer level benefits that are constant throughout the lifetime of the policy. However, some term plans also offer the ability for the benefit to change over the lifetime of the policy. Increasing benefits are suited for invididuals with financial obligations that are expected to increase over time: Inflation will increase the price of goods and services over time Lifestyle inflation where individuals tend to make more expensive lifestyle choices as their income grows Parents with kids tend to have large one-off expenses due to University or Marriage that occur much later Note An increasing benefit term policy can be thought of as a combination of: Level benefit term plan equal to the starting benefit Level benefit term plan \"purchased\" each period to account for the increase in coverage The cost of the second component increases over time. Depending on the policy structure, it might have been cheaper to purchase a level term with the final desired benefit from the beginning. Tip Typically, any change to the benefit level made post-inception requires the insured to go through medical underwriting. However, an increasing benefit plan guarantees the increase, without the need for medical underwriting. Decreasing benefits are suited for individuals with financial obligations that are expected to decrease over time: Loan balance decreases over time with each payment Children increasingly earn more income as they enter the workforce, reducing their dependency on parents Note In Singapore, Mortgage Insurance is compulsory when purchasing a HDB, known as the Home Protection Scheme . Return of Premium \u00b6 Term plans can also offer a Return of Premium (ROP), where upon lapsing or expiration the policy, the insured is returned the total amount of premiums paid till that point , hence \"returning\" the premium paid back to them. The feature is typically only available after a specified duration in-force. This feature is used to attract customers who view term insurance as a waste as they will not receive any benefit should the insured outlive the policy term. The feature essentially provides a capital guarantee on their purchase. It also helps in the retention of policyholders as they is no risk if they pay premiums; the premium will be returned to them. Naturally, the premiums are higher than a regular term policy as there needs to be additional capital used to build up the cash value on top of the regular insurance coverage. More information on cash values will be covered in the permanent insurance subsection. Unlike a permanent policy, the cash value is only available after a specified duration or up till a certain age , usually the end of the policy period. Some ROP policies are also convertible, where the cash value can be transferred into a new permanent policy and continue to accumulate. Waiver of Premium \u00b6 Convertibility \u00b6 Another commonly offered feature is the option to convert the term policy into a Permanent policy. The option to convert is only valid for a specified period , usually much shorter than the policy period. It is usually meant for insureds who wanted to purchase a permanent policy but could not afford to do so at the time or for insureds who suspect that their circumstances might change in a way that may require a permanent policy instead. Attained Age Conversion Original Age Conversion Prospective conversion Retroactive conversion Premiums based on age as at conversion Premiums based on age as at original age Premium rates as at conversion date Premium rates as at original date No additional payment required Difference in premiums & interest must be paid Insureds might prefer the Original Age conversion as they would get a lower premium and more liberal coverage due to the lower age. However, premium rates have been decreasing over the years, which may make an Attained Age conversion more attractive. Even if the rates were not better, the insured might not have the capital to pay back the premiums and interest, which makes the attained method more attractive. As with Renewability, the main purpose of this feature is to guarantee a conversion to a permanent policy, rather than having to purchase a new permanent policy. For healthy insureds, this option is worthless as they would be indifferent to converting or purchasing a new one - thus, there are usually some premium incentives to encourage conversion. Convertible policies provides an embedded option within the policy, which makes it more flexible but have higher premiums as a result.","title":"Term"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/0_TERM/#term-life-insurance","text":"","title":"Term Life Insurance"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/0_TERM/#overview","text":"The most basic type of life insurance is known as Term Insurance .

Although it is called Cash Value, receiving the amount in cash is not the only way the value can be passed on to the policyholder. Another option is that the amount is used as a Single Premium to purchase a Paid Up permanent insurance, usually with reduced coverage than the original. This converts the policy into a paid up one with reduced coverage, known as Reduced Paid Up (RPU) Insurance . Similarly, the amount can be used as a Single premium to purchase a paid up Term Insurance with the same coverage with a policy period for as long as the cash value can purchase. This extends the coverage of the insured via a term policy, which is why it is known as Extended Term Insurance . If the policyholder lapses the policy, one of the three options will be applied automatically, depending on what the insured specifies beforehand. Loans and Withdrawals \u00b6 Another way to access the cash value of the policy is through a Partial Withdrawal or Loan . The insured can withdraw a portion of their cash value, much like withdrawing funds from a bank account. However, any withdrawal will also lower death benefit by the same amount. This is to prevent the insured from receiving more than the coverage of the policy. For instance, assume that the death benefit was 100 and 50 was withdrawn. When the insured dies, they will receive 100 on top of the 50 they already took out, more than the coverage of the policy by the withdrawal amount. The insurer may also limit the withdrawals per year and/or charge an additional withdrawal fee (on top of the surrender charge, if any). Note that it is called a Partial withdrawal because a \"Full\" withdrawal of the cash value is equivalent to a surrendering the policy. In the same light, it can also be referred to as a Partial Surrender of the policy. Alternatively, the insured can take a Loan from the policy, much like taking a loan from any other financial instituition. Loans can be repaid at any time but the outstanding balance each period earns interest, usually at a rate equal to the rate credited to the cash value. Unlike a withdrawal, it does not immediately reduce the death/surrender benefit of the policy. However, the policy benefits will be used as collateral for the loan - if the insured does not repay the loan balance by the time the policy makes a payout, then the loan balance will be deducted from the benefits. Note that if the outstanding balance of the loan exceeds the Cash Value of the policy, the insured has a grace Pperiod to make loan repayments, otherwise the policy will Lapse . Most policies also contain an Automatic Premium Loan (APL) feature - whereby if the insured has not paid their premiums by the end of the grace period, the policy will automatically take a loan against the cash value of the policy to pay the premium and keep the policy in force. Note that the surrender benefit must be smaller than the death benefit , otherwise there would be no reason for the insured to keep the policy as they would earn more by surrendering it.","title":"Whole Life"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/1_WHOLE_LIFE/#whole-life","text":"","title":"Whole Life"},{"location":"1_PRODUCTS/1_WHOLE_LIFE/#nonforfeiture-options","text":"All permanent insurance contracts have a non-forfeiture clause which states that the insured will not forfeit the value of the policy when the policy is terminated (unlike in Term), which is why they build up cash values to provide an alternative form of value in the policy.

For instance, the credited interest rate and expenses are typically non-guaranteed elements as they depend on market conditions at the time. However, insurers also provide Guaranteed Elements in the policy to limit the variance of the NGE. This comes in the form of guaranteed minimum benefits or maximum charges for the non-guaranteed elements. The insurer has the discretion to change the NGE within the bounds of their guarantees. These non-guaranteed elements allows the insured to share the experience of the insurer, which may allow them to be better off compared to an otherwise all guaranteed policy. Policyholder Reasonable Expectation \u00b6 Projecting the maximum illustrated assumed interest rates (generally, 12%), using current (or assumed) administrative expenses and current costs of insurance, without showing the prospective client several other assumed rates of return, creating a Blue Sky problem. The divisible surplus will then be split among all par policies in an equitable way, depending on how much they contributed to the surplus. The mechanics of this split will be covered in the section on In Force Management. Naturally, dividends are a NGE as they are dependent on the past experience of the insurer. Despite being non-guaranteed, insureds often feel cheated if what they receive is significantly different from what was advertised on the policy illustration. While the insurers were not at fault, this has caused reputational issues in the past thus it is in the insurers best interest to payout dividends at a rate close to what was advertised . Insurers accomplish this by smoothing the dividends over time, avoiding large fluctuations. When the surplus is above the advertised rate, the excess may be held back to compensate for potential years where the surplus falls short. A participating policy ( par policy ) is one that participates profit sharing , making them entitled to a portion of the insurers profits, known as Dividends/Bonus . The proportion of profits that must be distributed is known as the Divisible Surplus , which is dependent on regulation. In Singapore, the ratio is 9:1 - for every $9 given to insureds, the insurer is able to take $1 as profit. The Dividend can then be passed on to the insurer in one of a few ways: Cash - Paid to the policyholder Premium Reduction - Offsets the premiums for the period/future periods Accumulate at Interest - Held with the insurer and earns compound interest; value is added to the benefit of the policy Purchase Paid Up Additions (PUA) - Used as a single premium to purchase as much paid up permanent insurance as it can, adding to the overall coverage of the policy; PUAs can be par, allowing them to earn additional dividends In Singapore, most dividends accumulate at interest with the insurer. It usually comes in two components: Reversionary Bonus (RB) - Credited annually to the insured at a rate based on the SA of the policy. Most policies also allow it to compound; allowing previously earned bonuses to earn interest as well. Terminal Bonus (TB) - Residual surplus left after all reversionary bonuses have been paid. It is paid out as a lump sum when the policy terminates, on top of the Death/Surrender/Maturity benefit as a percentage of the SA. The amount of any terminal bonus payable depends on how long you have had your policy percentage of the accumulated reversionary bonus Most non-par policies contain other NGEs apart from dividends, thus there is no need to purchase a par policy to share the experience of the insurer.

The cost of insurance coverage (and other necessary expenses) are deducted from the account every period. The account value is also the cash value of the policy which can be fully or PARTIALLY withdrawn after an initial period. The policy lapses when the account value is depleted . The interest earned on the account is known as the Crediting Rate , which typically has a minimum floor to ensure the account grows, but consequently also has a maximum ceiling on the returns. The insurer earns the spread of the crediting rate and their actual return on their investments. Traditional UL : Based on the performance of the insurer's investments Indexed UL : Based on the performance of a specified index Variable UL : Based on the performance of a specific mutual fund Note In the case of IUL and VUL, there is also a Participation Rate which defines how closely the crediting rate tracks the specified portfolios. Warning The account is purely notional - the index or mutual fund is not actually purchased under the policy. Universal Life is known for its flexibility as the policyholder can choose how much premium to pay each period as well as adjust their benefit post-inception (subject to underwriting). Tip It is useful to think of UL as a YRT with an account value, where the cost of the YRT is deducted from the fund. Sum at Risk \u00b6 There are typically two kinds of Universal Life plans: Option A Option B Level death benefit Increasing death benefit Decreasing sum at risk Constant sum at risk The policy will pay out either the death benefit or the account value. Thus, the cash value can be used to fund the death benefit . The shortfall is known as the Sum at Risk (SAR), which is the amount of coverage the insurer provides, which is the basis for the COI charge. Option A universal life is a plan where the sum at risk changes based on the account value. In an ideal scenario where the account value is growing, option A results in a decreasing SAR over time. If the SAR reaches 0, then there is essentially NO insurance coverage provided, thus the policy is no longer considered an insurance contract and hence does not enjoy the typical statutory benefits. Thus, to avoid the above scenario, the death benefit will be automatically increased once the account value catches up to it. The amount that the death benefit is increased is known as the Corridoor . It is defined as a proportion of the account value, typically the minimum amount of SAR that is needed to be considered an insurance contract. Option B universal life is much simpler, where the death benefit is a combination of the account value and the sum assured. The death benefit scales proportionally with the account value, resulting in a constant SAR . Target Premium \u00b6 Since there are no premium requirements, policyholders have a high chance of under-paying the policy, causing it to lapse earlier than expected. However, because there are no premium requirements, insureds are more likely to lapse their policies as they may end up paying too little or not at all. Insurers attempt to minimize this by providing a target premium that the insured should aim to pay each period to keep the policy adequately funded. This target premium is also often the maximum premium that agents can earn the standard commission rate. Premiums paid in excess of the target earn lesser commissions. This incentivises agents to recommend the insured to pay at least the target premium. However, this method has limited effectiveness as the decision ultimately sits with the insured.

This target premium is also often the maximum premium that agents can earn the standard commission rate. Premiums paid in excess of the target earn lesser commissions.

Thus, a large portion of life insurance regulations exist to minimize the risk of claim payment defaults. This is done via stringent capital requirements which requires the insurer to minimally maintain a prescribed level of assets over liabilities, which should provide an adequate buffer against unexpected claims. Note that regulations CANNOT completely prevent the failure or default of an insurer without also hindering their operations, thus the regulation does not seek to fully prevent insolvency, but rather to ensure that the insurer can fulfil their financial obligations to policyholders. History \u00b6 From the birth of insurance to the late 20 th century, such regulations involved FIXED capital requirements that were arbitrarily based on the judgment of the regulators at the time. However, such regulations failed to properly account for the differences in risk across insurance companies as all companies had to hold the same amount, regardless of risk profile. Info For instance, regulators could mandate that all insurers had to at least hold 50 million in assets at all times. These regulations worked reasonably well till a large number of insolvency's in the late 20 th century made it clear that it was insufficient for modern life insurance at the time. Thus, there was a push towards Risk Based Capital (RBC) requirements, where each insurer has a DIFFERENT capital requirement, proportionate to their risk profile . Key Mechanics \u00b6 Most jurisdictions have adopted RBC requirements with slight variations. However, they all typically follow a similar structure where they require each insurer to determine a Capital Ratio of their available capital to their required capital (RC). \\[ \\text{Capital Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Available Capital}}{\\text{Required Capital}} \\] The key mechanism is that there will be several prescribed thresholds that if breached, grant the regulators authority to take action against the insurer. There are typically at least two levels: Higher Threshold : If breached, insurer must submit action plan to restore capital Lower Threshold : If breached, regulator will be directly involved in the planning and/or implementation of above plan There could be additional thresholds which even allow the regulator to take control of the company or force the company to transfer its portfolio to another insurer No matter how robust the framework is, no single ratio can give a complete picture of an insurers financial situation. However, it will allow the early identification of weakly capitalized insurers, allowing the corrective action to begin sooner, minimizing the chances of insolvency. Required Capital \u00b6 The key idea of RBC is that insurers should hold capital proportional to the amount of risk they hold. The minimum amount of capital is known as the Required Capital . It typically has the following aspects: There are several risk categories (EG. Insurance Risk, Asset Risk) Within each category, it can be further broken into sub-categories (EG. Mortality Risk, Longevity Risk) RC for each sub-category is calculated as the additional capital needed to cover liability under that particular risk scenario The RC is aggregated within the sub-categories and then among the main categories to account for Covariance to reflect that these risks are unlikely to occur together Note For the calculation of sub-category RC under point 3, it is typically calculated as the increase in liability when the assumption relevant to the risk is shocked . For instance, the mortality risk could be calculated using 20% upward shock to mortality. The amount to shock is typically prescribed by the local regulator, which is typically calibrated at a desired risk level. Most insurers are conservative and hold more reserves than the best-estimate liability. These prudence reserves can be used to contribute towards the required capital. However, since the conservatism assumed is typically less than the prescribed shock , insurers typically need to come up with additional capital to fulfil the required capital. Available Capital \u00b6 The key idea is that not all items on the balance sheet will be available to fulfil policyholder liabilities .

In other words, they want to ensure that insurers are solvent , having more assets than liabilities. This is done by imposing a minimum amount of capital that insurers must hold in order to run the business. Depending on the extent that insurers fall below this minimum threshold, the regulators have the legal authority to require submission of action plans to restore their capital position or to take control of the company. It is a common misconception to think that fulfilling the minimum capital requirements will ensure that solvency of the insurer. The purpose is for the regulators to monitor the performance of insurers and identify weakly capitalized ones , allowing them to take regulatory action to ensure that policyholders receive their promised benefits. In the past, capital requirements were fixed; every insurer was subjected to the same amount. However, this failed to account for differences in the size and risk of the company, which led to many insolvencies in the US during the 1980s. Thus, risk based capital requirements were created, where companies had different capital requirements in proportion to their size and risk . Risk Based Capital 2 (RBC2) \u00b6 In Singapore, solvency is governed through the Risk Based Capital 2 framework, outlined in MAS Notice 133 - Valuation and Capital Framework for Insurers . 1. Solvency Ratios \u00b6 Under RBC2, there are two key ratios that are measured - Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and Fund Solvency Ratio (FSR). Both have the same formula, but measured at different levels. CAR is measured at the company level while FSR is measured at the insurance fund level. \\[ \\text{CAR/FSR} = \\frac{\\text{Financial Resources (FR)}}{\\text{Total Risk Requirement (TRR)}} \\] There are thresholds set by MAS for these two ratios: Prescribed Capital Requirement (PCR) - CAR/FSR > 100% Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR) - CAR/FSR > 50% If the company does not meet the PCR, then they will need to submit an action plan to restore its capital position within a certain timeframe. If the company fails to meet to the MCR, then MAS has the right to revoke their license and impose management actions within the company. In practice, MAS also sets another internal threshold above the PCR, usually around 135% for life insurers. Within the company, the threshold is usually higher, around 170%. 2. Financial Resources \u00b6 Tier 1 Resource Tier 2 Resource Concentration penalty 3. Risk Requirements \u00b6 Risk Requirements (or Risk Charges) are the minimum amount of additional capital (on top of BEL) that must be held by the insurer for taking on risk. It is similar to PAD - it is additional capital that needs to be held to protect against unfavourable outcomes. However, there are two key differences. PAD only considers Insurance related risks and is internally set, while Risk Requirements also considers non-insurance risk and is prescribed . The Total Risk Requirement is the sum of its three components : C1 Risk Requirement - Insurance Risk C2 Risk Requirement - Asset Risk Operational Risk Requirement (ORR) Note that TRR and each individual component is floored at 0 - it will not be negative. There will not be any reduction in required capital below BEL. 3.1 C1 Risk Requirement - Insurance Risk \u00b6 It is based on the risk associated with insurance contracts written by the company. Risk Shock Mortality Risk Longevity Risk Disability Risk Dread Disease Risk Expense Risk Lapse Risk Option Conversion Risk It is unlikely that all these risks happen together at once - thus, there is no need to hold capital for ALL of the risks at once. We consider a diversified risk requirement instead - which will always be smaller than if the original values were added together. The relationship between risks are prescribed in a correlation matrix: \\[ \\begin{align} \\text{Diversified C1} = \\sqrt{Corr_{r,c} * C1_{r} * C1_{c}} \\end{align} \\] 3.1a PAD vs C1 \u00b6 C1 and PAD are very similar as both deal with Insurance Risk and involve shocking the assumptions used. The key difference lies in the assumptions shocked and the magnitude of the shock. PAD = 90% Var ~ 50% of C1 C1 = 99.5 C1 Risk Charge = C1 Requiremtn - Pad 3.2 C2 Risk Charge - Asset Risk \u00b6 It is based on the risk associated with assets held by the company. We can split the risk requirements into two categories - Market and non-market related risks. Similar to C1, we can consider a diversification between the two. The diversification factor is a fixed value of 0.5. \\[ \\begin{align} \\text{Diversified C2} = C2_{misc} + \\sqrt{C2^{2}_{Default} + C2^{2}_{Market} + 0.5 * C2_{Default} * C2_{Default}} \\end{align} \\] Within the market risks, we can also consider a diversification benefit between them. There is a different correlation matrix to use, depending on which interest rate scenario is used. \\[ \\begin{align} C2_{Market} = \\sqrt{Corr_{r,c} * C2_{Market,r} * C2_{Market,c}} \\end{align} \\] 3.3 Operational Risk Requirement \u00b6 Operational risk refers to the risk of loss arising from company operations such as inadequate internal controls or processes, organisational changes or human errors. It is harder to monitor every process within a larger organization, thus the operational risk requirement is calculated based off the size of the firm, measured through either premiums or liabilities of the firm. $ \\ORR_{Premium} = 4\\% * GWP_1 + max(0, 4\\% * (GWP_0 - GGP_1) - 20\\% * GWP_0) \\ORR_{Liabilities} = 0.5\\% * \\text{Gross Liabilities} \\ORR_{Calculated} = Max (ORR_{Premium}, ORR_{Liabilities}) $ GWP stands for Gross Weighted Premium, which is measure of the premium received during a specified period. It is used to account for fluctuations in Single and Limited Pay business, which tends to be sensitive to market conditions. Premium Paying Term Weight Single Pay 10% Limited Pay 10% * Number of Years Regular Pay 100% 3.4 Total Risk Requirement \u00b6 Similar to before, it is unlikely that both C1 and C2 risks occur together, thus we consider a diversified risk requirement instead. \\[ \\text{Diversified C1 and C2} = \\sqrt{C1^{2} + C2^{2}} \\] Similarly, the operational risk requirement should not take up a significant portion (~10%) of the overall requirement. \\[ \\text{ORR} = Min(ORR_{Calculated}, 10\\% * (\\text{Diversified C1 and C2})) \\] Thus, the total Risk Requirement is the sum of all three final components: \\[ \\text{TRR} = (\\text{Diversified C1 and C2}) + \\text{ORR} \\] 4. Discount Rates \u00b6 As with Valuation, Risk Requirements are calculated using risk free rates obtained from government yield curves. Insurance cashflows are extremely long term, thus requiring a risk free rate spanning up to a maximum of 100 years. However, governments typically do not issue such super long lasting bonds. The longest bond issued is around 20 to 30 years long. Even if there was a bond that lasted up to 100 years, it will probably be a rare one-off exception. Thus, there is insufficient liquid data to determine the risk free rate beyond the 20-30 year time horizon. 4.1 Smith Wilson Method \u00b6 The smith-wilson method can thus be used to extrapolate the risk free rate beyond the 20-30 year horizon up till whatever time horizon required. It is based off three key concepts: Last Liquid Point (LLP) - the last period at which liquid government yield curve data is available Ultimate Forward Rate (UFR) - a proxy for the long term economic interest rates Convergence Point - the first period at which the UFR starts The idea is to split the time horizon into three distinct segments: Time Horizon Spot Discount Rates Valuation Date to LLP Government Yield Curve data LLP to Convergence Point Extrapolate from LLP to UFR Convergence Point Onwards Derived based on UFR MAS has prescribed the LLP, Convergence Point and UFR to use for most major currencies: The only parameter that is not prescribed is the Speed of Convergence \\(\\alpha\\) , which controls the rate at which the LLP moves towards the UFR. It is to be chosen in such a way that results in an acceptable level of divergence from the UFR at the convergence point. 4.2 Matching Adjustment & Ill-liquidity Premium \u00b6 Discounting Matching Adjustments If Assets and Liabilities are met, then it means that the assets held are long term Should have higher yield, can increase discount rate and hence decrease PV of liabilities Ill Liquidity premium Long term assets are ill liquid (hard to sell) thus should get higher return than RFR can increase discount rate and hence decrease the PV of liabilities and at the fund/asset level > Because all liabilities are backed by funds (Balance sheet concept) Insurance funds > Overseas Insurance Funds (OIF) vs Singapore Insurance Funds (SIF) Policy type > Par vs non par Asset = Liabilities Current liabilities Surplus ILP/Non par = RFR PAR = ASSET + INv yield The Smith-Wilson method is part of the broader class of curve-fitting techniques. It is designed to fit a term structure of interest rates to observed market data, such as swap rates or government bond yields, and then extrapolate that term structure to longer maturities where market data may be sparse or unavailable The method starts by fitting the term structure to the observed market rates. It ensures that the term structure reproduces these rates accurately at the given maturities. For maturities beyond the available market data, the Smith-Wilson method extrapolates the term structure towards an ultimate forward rate (UFR). The UFR reflects the long-term equilibrium interest rate that the market expects. The extrapolated rates smoothly converge to the UFR as the maturity increases, ensuring a realistic and stable long-term projection. The extrapolation aligns with the prescribed UFR by the MAS, which reflects a long-term stable interest rate. This approach under RBC 2 helps ensure that the valuation of liabilities is robust and reflective of both current and expected future market conditions, thus contributing to the overall financial stability of the insurance sector. Always converge to UFR; LT spot rate is always the same The UFR represents the long-term equilibrium interest rate towards which the extrapolated yield curve is expected to converge. It reflects the long-term expectations of interest rates based on macroeconomic factors. Purpose: The parameter \u03b1 (often referred to as the convergence speed or decay factor) controls the speed at which the yield curve converges to the UFR. Effect: A higher \u03b1 value results in a faster convergence of the yield curve towards the UFR, while a lower \u03b1 value means slower convergence. A high Alpha value will make the yield curve steep at shorter maturities, moving quickly towards the UFR, while a low Alpha value leads to a flatter curve, with the long end of the curve approaching the UFR more gradually. Exponential Decay: Alpha is associated with the exponential decay function in the Smith-Wilson framework. The function typically looks like e\u2212\u03b1te\u2212\u03b1t, where tt is time (or maturity). This decay function influences how much weight the extrapolated curve gives to the UFR as opposed to observed market data. The Matching Adjustment is intended to reduce the artificial volatility in an insurer\u2019s balance sheet by recognizing the additional return that can be earned from holding illiquid assets over long periods, where the insurer's liabilities are also illiquid. It provides a way to reflect the insurer's ability to hold assets to maturity, thereby allowing the valuation of liabilities to more closely align with the expected returns on the corresponding assets. To apply the Matching Adjustment, the insurer must demonstrate that the assets are closely matched to the liabilities in terms of both timing and amount. The cash flows from the assets must closely match the expected cash flows from the insurance liabilities. The Matching Adjustment is calculated as the difference between the yield on the matching assets and a risk-free rate, adjusted for the cost of credit risk (often referred to as the Fundamental Spread). By using the Matching Adjustment, insurers can reduce the present value of their long-term liabilities, which in turn can reduce their capital requirements under the RBC 2 framework. This reflects the lower risk associated with holding matched assets and liabilities.","title":"**Risk Based Capital** (RBC)"},{"location":"3_SOLVENCY/5_Statutory_Reporting/#risk-based-capital-rbc","text":"","title":"Risk Based Capital (RBC)"},{"location":"3_SOLVENCY/5_Statutory_Reporting/#background","text":"The primary objective of insurance regulators is to ensure that insurance companies can fulfil their financial obligations to policyholders.

It is designed to fit a term structure of interest rates to observed market data, such as swap rates or government bond yields, and then extrapolate that term structure to longer maturities where market data may be sparse or unavailable The method starts by fitting the term structure to the observed market rates. It ensures that the term structure reproduces these rates accurately at the given maturities. For maturities beyond the available market data, the Smith-Wilson method extrapolates the term structure towards an ultimate forward rate (UFR). The UFR reflects the long-term equilibrium interest rate that the market expects. The extrapolated rates smoothly converge to the UFR as the maturity increases, ensuring a realistic and stable long-term projection. The extrapolation aligns with the prescribed UFR by the MAS, which reflects a long-term stable interest rate. This approach under RBC 2 helps ensure that the valuation of liabilities is robust and reflective of both current and expected future market conditions, thus contributing to the overall financial stability of the insurance sector. Always converge to UFR; LT spot rate is always the same The UFR represents the long-term equilibrium interest rate towards which the extrapolated yield curve is expected to converge. It reflects the long-term expectations of interest rates based on macroeconomic factors. Purpose: The parameter \u03b1 (often referred to as the convergence speed or decay factor) controls the speed at which the yield curve converges to the UFR. Effect: A higher \u03b1 value results in a faster convergence of the yield curve towards the UFR, while a lower \u03b1 value means slower convergence. A high Alpha value will make the yield curve steep at shorter maturities, moving quickly towards the UFR, while a low Alpha value leads to a flatter curve, with the long end of the curve approaching the UFR more gradually. Exponential Decay: Alpha is associated with the exponential decay function in the Smith-Wilson framework. The function typically looks like e\u2212\u03b1te\u2212\u03b1t, where tt is time (or maturity). This decay function influences how much weight the extrapolated curve gives to the UFR as opposed to observed market data. The Matching Adjustment is intended to reduce the artificial volatility in an insurer\u2019s balance sheet by recognizing the additional return that can be earned from holding illiquid assets over long periods, where the insurer's liabilities are also illiquid. It provides a way to reflect the insurer's ability to hold assets to maturity, thereby allowing the valuation of liabilities to more closely align with the expected returns on the corresponding assets. To apply the Matching Adjustment, the insurer must demonstrate that the assets are closely matched to the liabilities in terms of both timing and amount. The cash flows from the assets must closely match the expected cash flows from the insurance liabilities. The Matching Adjustment is calculated as the difference between the yield on the matching assets and a risk-free rate, adjusted for the cost of credit risk (often referred to as the Fundamental Spread). By using the Matching Adjustment, insurers can reduce the present value of their long-term liabilities, which in turn can reduce their capital requirements under the RBC 2 framework. This reflects the lower risk associated with holding matched assets and liabilities.","title":"4.2 Matching Adjustment &amp; Ill-liquidity Premium"},{"location":"Archive/1_Actuarial/1_Actuarial_Overview/","text":"Introduction to Actuarial Science \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 It is a multi-disciplinary field that has elements of Finance, Statistics and Economics to model and quantify the financial impact of uncertain events - Risk . Practitioners of Actuarial Science are financial services professionals, known as Actuaries. They typically work in the insurance industry, thus are commonly known as insurance professionals . Becoming an Actuary \u00b6 To earn the professional designation of \"Actuary\", we have to go through a series of rigorous examinations governed by a professional body known as an Actuarial Society . Passing all the examinations allows one to gain membership in the society, earning an Actuarial title. There are two tiers of membership, based on how many examinations were completed: Associate of the Society (EG. Associate of the Society of Actuaries, ASA) Fellow of the Society (EG. Fellow of the Society of Actuaries, FSA) Actuarial Societies \u00b6 Each country typically has their own Actuarial Society to oversee the Actuaries working within. For instance, Singapore has our own Singapore Actuarial Society . However, not all societies offer examinations to become credentialed as an Actuary. Out of those that do, only a few are strongly recognised in Singapore: Society of Actuaries - SOA, United States Casaulty Actuarial Society - CAS, United States Canadian Institure of Actuaries - CIA, Canada Institute and Faculty of Actuaries - IFOA, United Kingdom Institute of Actuaries of Australia - IAA, Australia It typically does not matter which society we become credentialled unders as most employers will honour credentials from any of the above. Note Note that being a fellow in one society does not make officially a fellow in another; there is no formal mutual recognition in that sense. Naturally, the choice of society is obvious if we are already living in the region. For those outside, the choice typically boils down to accessibility or university program. Actuarial Programs \u00b6 In Singapore, we are fortunate that all societies offer examinations here. Thus, the choice mostly boils down to university program. Actuarial programs in university typically offer courses aim to equip students with the necessary knowledge to take the first few examinations. Each university in Singapore focuses on taking examinations with a different society: Singapore Management University Nanyang Technological University National University of Singapore Economics Second Major Business Specialisation Economics special program SOA IFOA IAA No Exemptions Exemptions Exemptions As alluded to above, some universities have collaborations with the respective societies to allow university courses to be used as examination credit (given a sufficiently high grade), allowing them to be exempted from taking those examinations. However, this also means that the examinations are partly regulated by the society and will be significantly harder than normal. As a result, there is no guarantee of scoring well enough for an exemption. Overall GPA/CAP will also be at risk, making it hard to switch out as well. Thus, it is not necessarily advantageous to go for programs that offer exemptions - it is a double-edged sword . Self Studying \u00b6 Regardless of University, NONE of them will be able to fully prepare students for taking on all the examinations. We will eventually have to study for the more advanced examinations from scratch on our own. Thus, it takes a lot of time and commitment to become an Actuary . This also means that we do not necessarily need a degree in Actuarial Science to become an Actuary - anyone in any phase of life can decide to transition into it by studying for it. More thoughts and information about the examination process can be found in the following section. Actuarial Career \u00b6 Reasons to become an Actuary \u00b6 Clear Career Path \u00b6 Unlike other fields of study where people struggle to know what they want to do, where they want to work, the gameplan is the same for all aspiring Actuaries - take actuarial examinations, learn about insurance and work in an insurance company! Most companies offers study benefits that increases our salary for each exam passed. Unlike other fields where social and technical skills are necessary to progress, even an average performing Actuary can progress their career by just studying - which they have full control over when and how they want to do so. Actuaries may not earn as much as the top investment banker, but will definitely earn more than the worst one. Along similar lines, this also means that the average Actuary will tend to earn more than the average white collar worker. High Job Security \u00b6 Insurance companies are mandated to have a credentialled Actuary sign off on its reserves every quarter. Most insurance companies are too large for a single Actuary to settle all the work - thus, a team of Actuaries will always be required. Insurance has an over 200 year history and is one of the backbones of our modern financial system. A single company may fall, but it is very unlikely for the entire industry to collapse in the foreseeable future. Actuarial credentials are recognised globally. Since Insurance is fundamentally the same, this allows Actuaries to work anywhere in the world. Furthermore, there are many exit opportunities to other disciplines within Insurance or other parts of the Financial Industry as well where Actuarial background will be beneficial. Work Environment \u00b6 The best thing about Actuarial is getting to work with other Actuaries. Actuarial is an extremely meritocractic profession. Anyone can bullshit on their resume or smooth talk during an interview, but not everyone can pass exams. Getting a professional designation shows determination, proven knowledge and rigor, which creates a high barrier to entry that keeps \"clowns\" out of the profession. Thus, your colleagues are likely to be similar to yourself - direct & low bullshit, making it easy to work with them. Similarly, due to the high barriers to entry, Actuarial is very insulated from competitive pressures, thus it is possible to go coast (slang for proceeding without effort ) and still do fine. Low Risk \u00b6 Actuarial pay is fairly standardized - if you pass x exams in y years, you will earn z dollars with little variance, making it a low-risk profession . Furthemore, the industry has remained largely unchanged over the years - only the regulation and tools have developed slightly. Some may argue that this is boring but others will love the long term predictability of the career. It is thus a great career for risk averse individuals who are willing to accept the lower pay in exchange for certainty and other qualitative benefits. Reasons NOT to become an Actuary \u00b6 High Opportunity Cost \u00b6 In order to reap the full benefits of the career, we must continually study and take exams till we become a Fellow. This occurs a huge opportunity cost as we could have used the time spent studying on other aspects of life. There are about 10 exams which each taking about 4-6 months of preparation, assuming we do not fail. Higher level exams are also offered only once a year, meaning that an unfortunate failure could push you back a whole year. It often takes years for someone to become a fellow. Conventional advice is to take most of the examinations as soon as possible while we are still fresh out of university with minimal commitments. However, this also means that while most of our peers are enjoying their youth, we spend most of days preparing for examinations. By the time we are finished and ready to enjoy, most of our peers would have begun to settle down. If we instead decide to enjoy life first, then other life commitments like starting a family may get in the way - making it hard to effectively study for exams. Either way, a tradeoff has to be made. Greener Grass \u00b6 There are many other professions out there that pay just as well or better than Actuarial, WITHOUT the need to take exams - EG. Big Tech, High Finance etc. The most common argument is that if you have the intellect and determination to pass rigorous exams, you have a decent chance at breaking into these roles if you put your mind to it. However, there are no barriers to entry in these fields, making it extremely competitive. Only those who are hardworking with the best skills & some luck are able to succeed. Furthermore, these industries (especially tech) are fast paced and innovative - although that makes the work more interesting, it also requires you to constantly put in the time and effort to keep up with the latest developments in the market. Failing to do so will result in you getting left behind quickly. Worklife Balance \u00b6 Counting all the study hours as working hours, this leads to Actuarial having an extremely poor worklife balance before fellowship. Coupled with the immense stress and anxiety involved in taking examinations, there are definitely better jobs out there. The great paradox of this profession is that in order to get work life balance, one must first give up worklife balance. Similarly, to get a well paying job that requires little effort, one must first get an average paying job that requires a lot of effort. Important Traits \u00b6 Business Sense \u00b6 There is a common misconception that people who are good at studying or likes math will do well in the career. This is largely due to the difficult credentialling process which requires a large amount of studying and mathematical skills. However, in practice, the math itself is nowhere near as complicated as the examinations - it mostly involves basic arithmetic done using Excel or a Programming language. Similarly, unlike in examinations, there is NEVER a definitive right or wrong answer - there is a lot of business sense surrounding the numbers. A large portion of the work involves communicating or justifying results to various stakeholders - who are often not as technically inclined. Thus, people who will do well in the career are those with a strong understanding of the business who can link their findings to the bigger picture and decisively act on it. Unfortunately, most people who are attracted to this job are those who tend to be very good at academics but nothing much else as they like the idea of getting paid to study (what they are good at) - which is not the type of people who will excel in the career. Technical Skills \u00b6 As mentioned, a lot of the day to day work involves using various software to manipulate data. The most common tool used is Microsoft Excel , as it allows us to view and manipulate the data at the smae time. However, as the industry grows, datasets become increasingly larger and thus we need software stronger and faster than Excel to work with the data - programming (VBA/SQL/R/Python/Scala/Java). Many Actuarial curriculums are beginning to include programming. However, many of them do not go deep enough into fundamental concepts of programming, just the barebones of how to operate the language. Some argue that people are too focused on developing technical skills as in 10 years time they are unlikely to be looking at spreadsheets or code often - just the results. Thus, there is a need to strike a balance between taking exams, picking up technical skills and acquiring business knowledge . Exit Opportunities \u00b6 Actuaries are regarded as Insurance Professionals - thus, it is possible to move horizontally to other functions within the industry to find success as well (Finance, Underwriting etc). Similarly, it is also possible to move into a different industry (EG. Banking) but handling the insurance aspect of the business as well. The Actuarial skillset is extremely diverse and is very transferrable outside the insurance industry. The issue is that the profession has poor marketing - most people do not know what an Actuary is and much less what they are capable of, making it hard to find opportunities outside of insurance. This is the biggest risk of the Actuarial career path. If the insurance industry collapses or if you decide you no longer want it, it will be hard to move out due to how specialized the career is. Thus, do not expect to be able to break into other industries after some years of experience. Even if there are opportunities to move, most would not go down that path as they have spent a significant amount of time and effort to be a credentialled actuary (Sunk Cost Fallacy). Data Science and Actuarial \u00b6 Some people are concerned that Actuaries would be replaced by Data Scientists in the near future. After all, both professions seemingly involve analyzing large volumes of data to make predictions about the future. However, the two roles are fundamentally different. An Actuary is more of a business analyst that makes use of some statistical theory, while data scientists are statisticians who apply their work to a business context. The issue with Data Science is that most of its cutting edge methods are often black boxes - there is no strong business intuition why it works, it just does. This is especially problematic in insurance due to the highly regulated and complicated nature of the industry as it is hard to justify the results. What makes an Actuary valuable is their ability to analyze and explain the results to key stakeholders like Management or Regulators. Actuarial methods may not be as accurate as modern methods, but they are driven by underlying economic intuition (consistent) rather than sourced from the data (inconsistent). Thus, it is unlikely that Data Scientists will replace Actuaries. It is more likely that these data scientists will work under actuaries to manipulate the increasing large volume of data, while actuaries synthesise the results to a business context. However, this makes it all the more important for the Actuarial skillset to expand towards more programming for them to perform these tasks themselves, or make it eaier to communicate with their data science subordinates.","title":"**Introduction to Actuarial Science**"},{"location":"Archive/1_Actuarial/1_Actuarial_Overview/#introduction-to-actuarial-science","text":"","title":"Introduction to Actuarial Science"},{"location":"Archive/1_Actuarial/1_Actuarial_Overview/#overview","text":"It is a multi-disciplinary field that has elements of Finance, Statistics and Economics to model and quantify the financial impact of uncertain events - Risk .

However, there are no barriers to entry in these fields, making it extremely competitive. Only those who are hardworking with the best skills & some luck are able to succeed.

This is largely due to the difficult credentialling process which requires a large amount of studying and mathematical skills. However, in practice, the math itself is nowhere near as complicated as the examinations - it mostly involves basic arithmetic done using Excel or a Programming language. Similarly, unlike in examinations, there is NEVER a definitive right or wrong answer - there is a lot of business sense surrounding the numbers. A large portion of the work involves communicating or justifying results to various stakeholders - who are often not as technically inclined. Thus, people who will do well in the career are those with a strong understanding of the business who can link their findings to the bigger picture and decisively act on it. Unfortunately, most people who are attracted to this job are those who tend to be very good at academics but nothing much else as they like the idea of getting paid to study (what they are good at) - which is not the type of people who will excel in the career.","title":"Business Sense"},{"location":"Archive/1_Actuarial/1_Actuarial_Overview/#technical-skills","text":"As mentioned, a lot of the day to day work involves using various software to manipulate data. The most common tool used is Microsoft Excel , as it allows us to view and manipulate the data at the smae time. However, as the industry grows, datasets become increasingly larger and thus we need software stronger and faster than Excel to work with the data - programming (VBA/SQL/R/Python/Scala/Java). Many Actuarial curriculums are beginning to include programming. However, many of them do not go deep enough into fundamental concepts of programming, just the barebones of how to operate the language. Some argue that people are too focused on developing technical skills as in 10 years time they are unlikely to be looking at spreadsheets or code often - just the results. Thus, there is a need to strike a balance between taking exams, picking up technical skills and acquiring business knowledge .","title":"Technical Skills"},{"location":"Archive/1_Actuarial/1_Actuarial_Overview/#exit-opportunities","text":"Actuaries are regarded as Insurance Professionals - thus, it is possible to move horizontally to other functions within the industry to find success as well (Finance, Underwriting etc). Similarly, it is also possible to move into a different industry (EG. Banking) but handling the insurance aspect of the business as well. The Actuarial skillset is extremely diverse and is very transferrable outside the insurance industry. The issue is that the profession has poor marketing - most people do not know what an Actuary is and much less what they are capable of, making it hard to find opportunities outside of insurance. This is the biggest risk of the Actuarial career path. If the insurance industry collapses or if you decide you no longer want it, it will be hard to move out due to how specialized the career is. Thus, do not expect to be able to break into other industries after some years of experience. Even if there are opportunities to move, most would not go down that path as they have spent a significant amount of time and effort to be a credentialled actuary (Sunk Cost Fallacy).","title":"Exit Opportunities"},{"location":"Archive/1_Actuarial/1_Actuarial_Overview/#data-science-and-actuarial","text":"Some people are concerned that Actuaries would be replaced by Data Scientists in the near future. After all, both professions seemingly involve analyzing large volumes of data to make predictions about the future. However, the two roles are fundamentally different. An Actuary is more of a business analyst that makes use of some statistical theory, while data scientists are statisticians who apply their work to a business context. The issue with Data Science is that most of its cutting edge methods are often black boxes - there is no strong business intuition why it works, it just does. This is especially problematic in insurance due to the highly regulated and complicated nature of the industry as it is hard to justify the results. What makes an Actuary valuable is their ability to analyze and explain the results to key stakeholders like Management or Regulators. Actuarial methods may not be as accurate as modern methods, but they are driven by underlying economic intuition (consistent) rather than sourced from the data (inconsistent). Thus, it is unlikely that Data Scientists will replace Actuaries. It is more likely that these data scientists will work under actuaries to manipulate the increasing large volume of data, while actuaries synthesise the results to a business context. However, this makes it all the more important for the Actuarial skillset to expand towards more programming for them to perform these tasks themselves, or make it eaier to communicate with their data science subordinates.","title":"Data Science and Actuarial"},{"location":"Archive/1_Actuarial/2_Credentialling_Process/","text":"Credentialling Process (USA Focused) \u00b6 The US has two societies due to differences in the 1900s. Originally there was only the SOA, but the P&C actuaries felt that their needs were not being met and hence started the CAS. Attempts have been made to recombine the two, but none have succeeded thus far. Within the US, SOA is mainly recognised for Life and Health insurance while the CAS is recognised for P&C insurance. CAS is not as well known outside of the US, thus SOA may be recognised for all lines of insurance. However, this exception is likely to fade away within the next few years as CAS expands internationally. Despite being seperate societies, the first two examinations are shared between both societies - a credit from the SOA can count towards CAS. Thus, to avoid wasting resources, conventional advice is to clear the shared examinations and then decide which society to pursue based on your first job. Which society to choose? \u00b6 Most people do not have a strong opinion about which line they end up in (Life vs Non-Life), so long as they have a job. Due to the specialized nature of the industry, very few people have sufficient working experience on both sides of the industry to form a proper opinion on which they prefer. Every comparison will thus be based on hearsay or limited experience - which should be taken with a pinch of salt. Thus, as stated in the previous section, conventional advice is to base the decision off where you start your first full-time job! It is NOT recommended to base it off internship experience alone as you could end up working in a completely different line post graduation no matter how many internships were done. How many examinations to complete by graduation? \u00b6 Most job postings do not have a hard requirement on the number of examinations that need to be completed - most simply state \"good progress in actuarial examinations\". For graduates, this usually translates to about ~2-3 examinations completed. After a few years of experience, this could potentially mean an Associate level or close to attaining it. There are two main reasons why stopping at 2-3 examinations is ideal: Job Opportunities - Having the maximum number of shared examinations completed provides the most opportunities in terms of employment. Overpriced - Having too many examinations completed without the relevant work experience to back it up may result in you being too expensive for the company to hire. Most people usually indicate the next examination they intend to take on thei Resume, showing that the are motivated and planning ahead. Naturally, this should be tailored towards the company - Life jobs should list an SOA examination while non-life jobs should list a CAS one.

If given a choice, it is optimal to a choose a track related to your field. This is because the whole point of being an Actuary is to be an expert in that line of insurance. Taking a related track will help deepen understanding in that field, directly benefitting your career.

There are almost no pre-requisites to the exams, thus giving us the flexibility to choose how we want to approach it. However, there are some points to consider: Related exams should also be taken one after another to ease the studying process as previous information is still fresh (FAM - ALTAM, SRM - PA - ATPA). Earlier examinations are more theoretical while later ones are more practical to the job. Some say that it is a good idea to take the practical ones first to help you on the job, while others argue that you should clear theoretical ones first while you are still fresh out of university. If there are new examinations , it is generally best to take the older ones first as there is suffificent history to know what to expect. On the other hand, some people argue that the first few sittings may be simpler or more lenient as the society attempts to gauge the difficulty of the exam. 1.6 Pathway Changes \u00b6 Exam Technicalities \u00b6 Each exam has a question pool, with each question having an associated difficulty level. Whenever a candidate sits for an exam, the questions are pulled from the pool to form the the exam. To ensure fairness, statistical scaling methods are used to ensure that exams generated within the same sitting are around the same difficulty level. Based on the overall difficulty of the exam generated, a pass mark is determined. It typically requires around 71% of the questions to be correct to pass. Based on our actual score, we are then grading accordingly to the scoring table below. Additionally, there will be two types of questions in each exam: Actual Questions - Counted towards the overall grade Pilot Questions - Not counted towards overall grade; for SOA to gauge difficulty only Thus, it may NOT be possible to obtain a score above a certain grade due to these pilots. For instance, If the exam was relatively easy with a passing mark of 21, but there are only 28 countable questions, then it is impossible to obtain grade 10 which requires 29 points! All this information was sourced based on Excerpts within the SOA syllabus (2022): As part of the computer-based testing process, a few pilot questions will be randomly placed in the exam (paper and pencil and computer-based forms). These pilot questions are included to judge their effectiveness for use on future exams, but they will NOT be used in the scoring of this exam. All other questions will be considered in the scoring. All unanswered questions are scored incorrect. Therefore, candidates should answer every question on the exam. There is no set requirement for the distribution of correct answers for the multiple-choice preliminary examinations. It is possible that a particular answer choice could appear many times on an examination or not at all. Candidates are advised to answer each question to the best of their ability, independently from how they have answered other questions on the examination. Since the CBT exam will be offered over a period of a few days, each candidate will receive a test form composed of questions selected from a pool of questions. Statistical scaling methods are used to ensure within reasonable and practical limits that, during the same testing period of a few days, all forms of the test are comparable in content and passing criteria. The methodology that has been adopted is used by many credentialing programs that give multiple forms of an exam. The ranges of weights shown in the Learning Objectives below are intended to apply to the large majority of exams administered. On occasion, the weights of topics on an individual exam may fall outside the published range. Candidates should also recognize that some questions may cover multiple learning objectives. 2.1 Scoring Table \u00b6 All exams are scored based on your Actual Score A and the Passing Score P for that paper: Grade Actual to Passing Ratio \\(0\\) \\(0 < A \u2264 0.5P\\) \\(1\\) \\(0.5 < A \u2264 0.6P\\) \\(2\\) \\(0.6P < A \u2264 0.7P\\) \\(3\\) \\(0.7P < A \u22640.8P\\) \\(4\\) \\(0.8P < A \u2264 0.9P\\) \\(5\\) \\(0.9P < A \u2264 P\\) \\(6\\) \\(P \u2264 A < 1.1P\\) \\(7\\) \\(1.1P \u2264 A < 1.2P\\) \\(8\\) \\(1.2P \u2264 A \u2264 1.3P\\) \\(9\\) \\(1.3P \u2264 A < 1.4P\\) \\(10\\) \\(1.4P \u2264 A < Maximum\\) Thus, candidates are NOT scored against another student - it is NOT a zero-sum game! 2.2 Study Material \u00b6 For each exam, SOA/CAS lists the textbooks or source material from which they use to create the questions. They also provide a list of sample questions or previous papers to practice. There are many companies who create their own study manuals or guides that summarize and organize the content in a logical and easy to understand fashion for studying. They also compile previous questions to create practice sets or quizzes to help drill in concepts at various checkpoints while studying. There are several popular ones: Coaching Actuaries (SOA) The Infinite Actuary (SOA/CAS) PAK Study Manual (SOA/CAS) ACTEX Study Manual (SOA/CAS) For preliminary exams, most people would recommend using these study guides to help familiarize with the material. However, for later exams, it is generally recommended to go through the textbook or source material directly as it is necessary to have a deep understanding of the content as obscure topics (that are often omitted in study material) are typically tested to catch candidates off guard. Examination Strategies \u00b6 Planning \u00b6 Always plan ahead in what order to clear the examinations and which sittings are optimal to fulfil that order. Having a rough timeline in mind allows you to plan other life or work events around it way ahead of time, preventing you from being too overloaded at any one point. It is recommended to only take one examination at a time - it may result in a longer pathway but it is better to guarantee passing one exam rather than to risk failing two! However, as some higher level examinations are only offered once or twice a year, it may be more efficient to take two papers together. Ultimately, it boils down to your risk preference. Most importantly, always plan for breaks or downtime between each exam. Due to the increasing difficulty between exams, it is very common to feel burnt out - so always make sure there is some planned enjoyment to reset after a paper! Later examinations do not have instant results. As such, it is recommended to clear modules during the ~2 month waiting time. If all the modules are done, then the time is better used to rest! Suggested Timeline \u00b6 It is recommended to only start studying about ~4 months before each sitting . Studying too early may result in burn out before the sitting, which may affect your ability to pass. The top priority is to always sweep through all the content to gain a high level understanding of it. After that, you should be exposed to as many practice questions as possible to refine our understanding of the content. It is recommended to create your own set of notes or a cheatsheet with key formulas and refer to it while practicing. This may allow you to tap into your photographic memory and picture the formulas in your head! Weeks before the paper, it is advised to take mock examinations without referring to notes and with a time limit in order to simulate and adapt to exam conditions. In the days leading up to the paper, focus should be on completing short quizzes and re-attempting questions that were done incorrectly. The day before and hours leading up to the paper is the most important. The most important thing is to be in the right mental and emotional state to walk into the examination room as confident as possible - thus, no new questions should be attempted, just reviewing past mistakes and going over key concepts & formulas. The golden rule of studying is that studying a small amount everyday is much better than studying a large amount just one day - consistency is key. Shortcuts \u00b6 Most exam problems can be solved via First Principles , which has the advantage of only needing to know a few formulas. However, the issue is that some problems can become extremely long winded, requiring a disproportionate amount of time to solve via first principles. Thus, it is advisable to memorize certain shortcuts for tedious methods to save precious time during the exam. During the examination \u00b6 Always sweep through the paper once, skipping any difficult or long winded questions. Only after the first pass is done, then return to these skipped questions. Once all is done, perform a sense check on our methods and answers to ensure we did not make a careless mistake. The reason is to \"secure\" questions that we know we can do, rather than spending time on questions we may not get right and risk not having enough time for questions we know. Similarly, some of these tougher questions could be pilot questions , which may not even count towards our grade anyway. Although time consuming, it is recommended to write out as much working as possible with all the parameters to reduce the chances of making an error. It also eases the checking process as we have something to work with. Multiple Choice Questions \u00b6 Do not fall into the trap of thinking that once one of the options is obtained that it should be the correct answer. Most questions have options that will be obtained if a wrong input or formula is used. For word based options, there are always a few options that are extremely similar to one another, with only one or two words that are different - choose the right ones! Always leave some time to check that the correct options have been selected. Do not throw away marks for carelessness. Along similar lines, never leave options as the option number on our working - always leave the exact value or phrase. This helps us to easily catch instances where we clicked the wrong option. Written Answer Questions \u00b6 Do not fall into the trap of thinking that longer and more detailed answers are better. These type of answers tend to be viewed as beating around the bush and thus may not be awarded the point. Each society typically has some guidelines on how to approach written answer questions with respect to what type of answer to give and how long the answer should be. 2.4 Technical Difficulties \u00b6 In the event that there are any technical issues with the computer, DO NOT try to resolve it yourself. Immediately contact the test centre staff to help you. Ensure that they STOP the examination timer as soon as possible as you do not want to lose precious exam time. In the event that the issue cannot be resolved on site immediately, ensure that the test centre provides a retake WITHIN THE SAME TESTING WINDOW . This is to ensure that all the effort put into studying is not wasted; so that you do not have to study another 4-6 months for the next sitting. DO NOT leave the test centre until this is confirmed - this will put pressure on them to resolve the situation properly. Always ask for names and numbers of staff members to be able to get confirmation or direct follow up on your case. 3. Company Support \u00b6 Most insurance companies have an Actuarial Study Program in place to support their actuaries in the credentialling process. The program ususally contains the following benefits: Reimbursement for the cost of the examination and related study material Extra days off to study and take examinations Salary increments for completing an examination However, these benefits usually come with some conditions as well: Reimbursement only for the first 2 attempts on the same exam Days off decreases with each failed attempt Bonded for a short duration (~3-6 months) after making use of any benefit Companies will only support exams from a specific society or tracks (EG. GI companies CAS, Life companies ILA FSA track) Salary Increments \u00b6 When finding a job, your salary is calculated in one of two ways: Base Pay (Negotiable) + Examination Increment per the company's study policy Package deal containing both (Negotiable) Entry level positions typically use option 1 while higher level positions use option 2 . There is no standard market practice for this. Employer Society Relationship \u00b6 These actuarial societies are not regulated by any official government body. Thus, there is no minimum pass rate that they must provide. However, they are in some sense \u201cregulated\u201d by Actuarial employers. This works the same was as how any business has to listen to its customers for feedback. The customers provide revenue for the business - if they feel that their needs are not being met, they would no longer patronise the business. Actuarial employers are the main ones who pay for these exams. Thus, the society has to set the pass rate such that they meet the needs of employers: Pass rates too low - Too few credentialed actuaries; talent supply is limited Pass rate too high - Too many credentialed actuaries; hard to tell the competent from incompetent Irrelevant content - Knowledge acquired through exams is not relevant to the job Actuarial societies can charge stupid amounts of money for each exam because they know that employers are paying for it no matter what. However, if the employers feel that the credential no longer holds its weight, they will no longer pay for it and the society will lose money.

Candidates are advised to answer each question to the best of their ability, independently from how they have answered other questions on the examination. Since the CBT exam will be offered over a period of a few days, each candidate will receive a test form composed of questions selected from a pool of questions. Statistical scaling methods are used to ensure within reasonable and practical limits that, during the same testing period of a few days, all forms of the test are comparable in content and passing criteria. The methodology that has been adopted is used by many credentialing programs that give multiple forms of an exam. The ranges of weights shown in the Learning Objectives below are intended to apply to the large majority of exams administered. On occasion, the weights of topics on an individual exam may fall outside the published range. Candidates should also recognize that some questions may cover multiple learning objectives.","title":"Exam Technicalities"},{"location":"Archive/1_Actuarial/2_Credentialling_Process/#21-scoring-table","text":"All exams are scored based on your Actual Score A and the Passing Score P for that paper: Grade Actual to Passing Ratio \\(0\\) \\(0 < A \u2264 0.5P\\) \\(1\\) \\(0.5 < A \u2264 0.6P\\) \\(2\\) \\(0.6P < A \u2264 0.7P\\) \\(3\\) \\(0.7P < A \u22640.8P\\) \\(4\\) \\(0.8P < A \u2264 0.9P\\) \\(5\\) \\(0.9P < A \u2264 P\\) \\(6\\) \\(P \u2264 A < 1.1P\\) \\(7\\) \\(1.1P \u2264 A < 1.2P\\) \\(8\\) \\(1.2P \u2264 A \u2264 1.3P\\) \\(9\\) \\(1.3P \u2264 A < 1.4P\\) \\(10\\) \\(1.4P \u2264 A < Maximum\\) Thus, candidates are NOT scored against another student - it is NOT a zero-sum game!","title":"2.1 Scoring Table"},{"location":"Archive/1_Actuarial/2_Credentialling_Process/#22-study-material","text":"For each exam, SOA/CAS lists the textbooks or source material from which they use to create the questions.

Even if it\u2019s just a salary issue, just because you get a bump now doesn\u2019t mean that you aren\u2019t going to be in the same place in a couple years. All employers have expected salary bands per level and if they give you a bump to not leave, it just means your future merit raises will be lower so they can fit you in your band. Edit: I should add that just because you are offered a counter, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they want to keep you, but rather they don\u2019t want to spend the resources to hire/train a replacement.

A good way to overcome this is to reduce friction behind asking questions: o Actively encouraging them to ask questions o Being responsive on your company\u2019s messaging platform o Scheduling follow-up meetings not long after assigning a task \u2022 When assigning tasks, always try to explain the rationale behind them (Big Picture), even if they don\u2019t necessarily need to know it to complete it. If possible, try to break it down into smaller pieces to help them connect everything together \u2022 DO NOT outright do things for them, even if it seems trivial to you.

Clarification beforehand is much better than assumption. Interview with VPs are probably more about big picture things and less about day to day. You can do some research on the VP and ask specific questions about his background. Ask about career growth, his vision on the teams you\u2019ll be working for. Actuarial program, etc. (A) study. This should be the answer until you get your ASA. (B) be proactive and ask your boss for more work. Only issue here is that once you enter busy time, your workload might be too much. Also, you then become expected to handle alot more tasks while on your current salary. (C) ask peer if they need any immediate help. I like this more than B because it typically just gives you non-longterm work and also helps build rapport with your coworkers. (D) go back and refine projects that you work on on a monthly/quarterly basis. Make code more efficient, build neater excel sheets, write documentation. I think this is the best since it shows you can take initiative on your own and also because it will make your job easier in the long run. Then when you become more senior, you transfer the tasks to others easily and get manager/teaching skills. (E) work on a side hustle. Wont advance you as far at work but can increase you income pretty easily. My side hustle was my house. I recently sold it and the tax-free profit from selling (200k) was more than the salary I earned for the 3-4 years I owned the place. (F) learn new skills that could earn you a higher paying tech job. It is highly advised to focus on examinations early on in your career while still relatively junior as you have fewer responsibilities. Once promoted to senior or management, it will be significantly harder to find time to study due to the increased responsibility and stress. There is also less incentive to study at higher levels as you would be earning much more - the few hundred dollars increment is insignificant at that point.

I'm not sure if this is/was true but it did impact my decision. Also, I'm under the impression that CS/DS has a much more unclear career progression, so while it's true that you can make a lot of money, getting those jobs seems to be a large function of networking and right place at the right time, which felt uncomfortably uncertain to me. And again, I know this exists to a large degree in the actuarial field also, but at least there is a clear progression I can follow to have a good chance of getting a good job in the future. Also, I consider myself a good test taker and don't really mind the exam process especially if the alternative is grad school.

And they've got a point because that's probably the most natural way we learn things. Schooling in general tends to have it backwards: a teacher visits a series of subjects that the students learn contextlessly to then tackle problems they were never primed for. And I think the course creators ape this for lack of a better front-of-mind template. But that's almost never how things work in the real world, in which you tend to get a problem + context first, which then requires some creativity and learning to figure out and solve. Hence why academic performance can feel more like theater than actually being predictive of real world productivity. So for an example of \"normal\" or okay teaching in other media, decent video game tutorials don't just infodump their mechanics to new players like schools and courses do -- that would be boring, right? Instead they show some of the problems necessitating them upfront before giving the player the tools to solve them, like a gap that cannot be crossed without using a double jump or glide item (with a reward you can see on the other side that you want to come back to later ofc), or an enemy that needs to be treated differently to be damaged using a new ability. It's so common as to be a design trope in video games ... now why might that be?

Tesla, Shoppee) Small regional outlet in SG for a large overseas insurer (EG. Swiss Life) Typically has a small actuarial team to help build up the business and hopefully expand Typically has no actuarial team at all as most of the work is done overseas No one else in the company would know what you are doing thus nobody can screw you, but that also means that if shit hits the fan nobody else can help you either Not enough work here to justify hiring a full team thus most of the work that needs to be done is outsourced to consulting Reinsurance Carriers \u2022 Work in a reinsurance company is very different \u2013 Rather than having individual policy data, you get a bird\u2019s eye view with aggregated portfolio level data \u2022 Data comes from different lines of business or different companies each with their own way of formatting it o Thus, they will also need interns or EL hires to clean the data and perform other menial tasks for them, much more so than primary/direct insurers \u2022 Working with a small amount of useful data means that an Actuary\u2019s knowledge and ability to deal with ambiguity is extremely important. This means that the work is very high level & complex \u2013 it is recommended to go into the field much later on when you are experienced and have much stronger understanding of Insurance Risk \u2022 It is not recommended to enter as EL and hope to climb as an incoming outsider with more diverse experience will be valued more Consulting can\u2019t teach you cos they dk even know what\u2019s going on since each project is new Consulting Firms \u2022 Consulting firms perform project-based work for Direct Companies: o Audits \u2192 Double checking the insurer\u2019s calculations o Advisory \u2192 One off projects for Insurer\u2019s who do not have the manpower or expertise to perform a certain task (EG. Small insurer, IFRS17) \u2022 Instead of working in a fixed department, Consultants typically work on multiple different projects, each with a different set of teammates \u2022 Working in consulting exposes you to a wide range of different functions within the industry as opposed to just one. Through working with different clients, you also get to a bird\u2019s eye view of the industry by understanding how & why their methods differ o This makes Consulting a rather appealing place to start early on in your career as it allows you to gain experience much faster which would have otherwise taken you 10 years of working and moving around o However, no two people\u2019s experience will be the same. Everyone would have taken on a different set of projects and learn different things. You can\u2019t predict with certainty exactly what you will be exposed to \u2022 Most of the project requires you to start from scratch or something to that effect as each project is new, rather than maintaining or updating a particular model or workflow. Teams are also a lot smaller which means that communication is much simpler \u2022 However, the work also tends to have tight deadlines meaning that everything is fast paced. Additionally, since the scope of the project varies, it is likely that you will need to learn a lot of things on the job as well. This makes Consulting a rather stressful choice with little work-life balance o This makes it harder to study for exams and get credentialed as an Actuary as you would not have the time and/or energy to do so o But if you have been in consulting since the start, you will be more used to the lifestyle and would be able to cope better than someone who transferred in \u2022 Different consulting firms tend to get different kind of projects: o Big 4 Accounting \u2192 Audits, Modelling o Actuarial Consulting \u2192 M&A and other high-level stuff Actuarial Roles \u2022 In both Life and General insurance, we can summarize actuarial work into 4 main areas: o Pricing \u2192 Calculates how much premium should be charged o Valuation/Reserving \u2192 Calculates how much capital needs to be held o Financial Reporting \u2192 Calculates how much should be reported as profits etc o Enterprise Risk Management \u2192 Maintaining the overall risk management framework for the company (Risk identification, limits, forecasts and defence etc) \u2022 Additional categories may be added for Life or General insurance specifically, but those functions are rather niche. Each category can also be split into more sub-categories, but this list is meant to be a broad overview Valuation/Reserving \u2022 Valuation work tends to be routine \u2013 Monthly & around key financial reporting dates \u2022 Outside of these weeks, the work is rather chill. This allows you to focus your time on other important aspects of your career \u2013 Exams, Upskilling & Networking \u2022 There are two other reasons why Valuation is especially good for newcomers: o Valuation is the most structured function. There are pre-defined methods to calculate the reserve, allowing you to properly learn how the product works and gain a stronger overall understanding of the business o Reserves dictate how much free cash is available for all the other aspects of the company. As such, all key stakeholders in the company are interested in it. This provides a strong opportunity to not only further your understanding of the business, but also to network or make yourself known to key stakeholders \u2022 Calculating the reserves will become easier and trivial over time. A key skill to pick up in this role is understanding WHY the reserves have moved and WHAT are the implications for the company. Once you have understood it, the next step it is to be able to EXPLAIN it a non-technical fashion to other stakeholders \u2022 However, one of the downsides is that it gets boring over time. Once you start to grasp the above concepts, the work is simply repeating the same things repeatedly o Some predict that advanced techniques such as Machine Learning may be used o While they can be more accurate, they are also black boxes which means that they are much harder to understand & explain to key stakeholders which makes it unlikely to be adopted o Some recommend using the downtime to help automate some of them tasks so that crunch periods are a lot more manageable Pricing Roles \u2022 Most insurance companies have been around for years or even decades with their own pricing models \u2013 Is there still anything to do? o Although the models were already built, they need to be updated to better reflect experience or the current economic environment o If the model was built long ago, updating the model to reflect modern methods (Predictive Analytics/Machine Learning etc) can also be considered o If the insurer releases a new product, then a new model must be built \u2013 this will involve a lot of market research and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) \u2022 In general, pricing work is more flexible than Reserving/Valuation as there are no fixed deadlines (Reporting periods etc) \u2022 It also includes interacting with other non-financial departments (Sales, Marketing & IT) to help operationalize the product etc Pricing and reserving are two sides of the same coin with different functions But the coin overall represents keeping an insurance company solvent Reserving is all about the policies already sold and seeks to make projections about how those libailities will develop so the company can keep enough capital to cover those losses Pricing is all about the policies that haven\u2019t been sold. Pricing ensures that prospective policies will generate enough capital to keep the company solvent and profitable for the liabilities it is about to incur Actuarial Career Advice Internship Choices \u2022 In general, there are two schools of thought: o Explore the Industry \u2192 Aim to intern in different LOBs and Roles o Specialize in a line of business \u2192 Aim to intern in the same LOBs & Roles \u2022 Internships are meant for you to gain experience in and know more about the industry. Thus, some people prefer to move around different parts of the industry to get a taste of everything to make a more informed career decision at the end \u2022 However, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive. Others also feel the need to specialize in a particular field so that they are favoured in the hiring process, or return to the same company to be able to easily convert to a full-time position \u2022 Regardless of which side of the argument you take, both can be easily countered: o Internships will only scratch the surface of what that line of work entails due to the limited time and skillset available. It is a decent good preliminary gauge on whether you will like that line of work, but it is by no means an accurate one o Specializing to get a head start is also redundant, as whatever head start you obtained through your internships will be immediately eclipsed the moment you start work \u2022 Thus, there is no right or wrong answer. Experience is experience \u2013 intern at whichever company offers you! Internship Performance \u2022 As stated before, internships are meant for you to learn \u2013 no one expects you to be productive at the start \u2022 What they do expect is that you show progress \u2013 show that you are learning and improving in your work \u2022 Depending on the nature of the programme, some internships may have formal trainings while others will not \u2013 either way, how much you learn is solely up to you: o If you have questions are or curious, you should try to think of an answer & then clarify when you cannot think of a suitable one o If you are given a simple task, finish it early and then explore \u2013 what was the underlying reasons it was done this way? \u2022 Always ask for feedback for whatever work you do \u2013 periodic feedback will help you improve throughout the internship as well o If you want to convert, you should not just say but show it. If you want to take on extra load, ask for it. As an intern, you decide what you get out of it Show illustrations, that\u2019s the best way to teach or convince Good to send updates often Structured thinking Test everything, understans what you want to do MAP is good but rotate between teams wont learn much Need to stay on after the bond is over for about a year to get your footing in that area then go away In most companies, salary adjustments and increments are a zero sum game Team can be performing very well around the board but managers forced to rank the team Always tied to a budget -thus zero sum game There are other ways to reward employees, but yearly bonus and increments are the main drivers for most employees Don\u2019t blame anyone for leaving because of salary \u2013 it is encouraged New hires typically hired based on the current market rate which changes New hires can be paid more than oldies It is up to the managers to fight and say that the long term employees are not being properly paid, budget is a lame excuse Workplace is a like never ending high school where people operate with teenage mentalities Coworkers get angry when you turn down their offers to hang out Boss is jealous of you because you have a healthy family lifestyle Asking for pay means radicalized against company culture Purposely mess up pay hours and benefits because they don\u2019t like you But remember your co workers are not your friends, don\u2019t ever treat them as such You don\u2019t need to tell therm everything about yourself Just because people don\u2019t help you or are not willing to help you does not make them your enemy Just because if someone helps you does not make them your friend Know your co-workers motivation, why are they still here and whats in it for them Don\u2019t be too valuable that you cant be promoted > Doing too much at your pay grade, too efficient and thus cant afford to promote you Never be too good at a bad job or be good not great There is literally no benefit to go beyond your contract The best employee is a skilled employee with major financial obligations Pay them a little above market rate and they will stay even under toxic management Fear/golden handcuffs prevent them from leaving Prevents most people from looking for jobs because the devil you know is better than the one you don\u2019t Life is too short to deal with a garbage manager Change teams or companies From managers perspective it is easier to nego pay bump if already have an offer in hand Promotion years are never formal but more of a cultural thing - bring it up to people giving you feedback When you demonstrate that you have been performing at the next level, theres a good chance you will be promoted Dont bother thinking that you can be partner etc - there are many other people ahead of you, but also a lot of people leave or dont want to take that role I expect to be compensated fairly for the value I bring to the company I consider compensation as a whole,m not just base salary The exact number depends on benefits, bonuises, stock, vacation time and other aspects Don\u2019t hide the fact that you are interviewing with other companies Im currently in the interview process with a few opportunities I like this companies and what this role offers but however im keeping myself open to other opportunities as well There are many people who will graduate and make close to 5 figures in SWE or finance If money is the main motive, there are definitely other places to be in I am in this for relatively low stress and ok money Credentials is a safety net Manager then HR NEGO Interview Questions (Fresh Grad Version) \u00b6 Let the interviewer talk Let them become ur frien For online interviews, there tends to be a short delay in when the interviewer enters the room and when the interview starts. Try to fill the gap with the following questions so that it is not awkward: How may I address you? Are you guys working from home? Is it a busy period now? If there delay is significant, some other questions to consider: What Actuarial Society are you taking under? Why did you take that society? Are they finished with their exams? How long did you take to become a fellow? or why haven't they been taking exams? 2. Past Experiences \u00b6 2.1 Chubb Insurance - Commercial Underwriting \u00b6 This internship was done in partnership with GIA, so we had a lot of training from both Chubb and GIA to understand how the Insurance industry works and the various stakeholders and products. I was part of the Casualty team so we focused on Liability products. I shadowed an underwriter and helped him with his work where I can. I learnt about how underwriters analyze risk both qualitatively and quantitatively. 2.1a Chubb Key Project - Grabfood Quotation \u00b6 My main takeaway from the internship was NOT to follow the numbers blindly - pay attention to fundamental reason behind the numbers. My mentor and I were working on the Grabfood account . At the time (2021), Grabfoods revenue had almost quadrupled - this would have warranted an increase in premiums based on the pricing model. But if you think about it, their performance was so good because we were in lockdown during that period - everyone was ordering food delivery. It was unlikely that the following year would have this well a performance as everyone would start returning to school and office as restrictions eased. If we had just followed the numbers blindly, we would have overcharged them and lost the business to a competitor. So we proposed to charge a significantly lower than the techncial premium. In an Actuarial context, we are not so close to the risk - but I think the principle can still be applied. Don't just go through the motion, try to understand whats driving the numbers a certain way. 2.2 EY - Life Valuation \u00b6 This was my first Life Actuarial Internship - so I spent a lot of time on my own learning about the different products and features and how to calculate the liability . I was working mainly on Audits and providing some minor support in other advisory projects - Pricing, ORSA and Market Research etc. 2.2a EY Key Project - Manulife Audit \u00b6 My main takeaway from the internship was to work independently . Consulting was fast paced and everyone was working on multiple projects at once - so I learnt that time was a very precious resource - nobody had the time to guide me step by step. Furthermore, it is everyone's first time looking at the project so no one knows all the answers from the get go. Clients may also take awhile to respond, so it takes awhile to get answers. I learnt how to look at past examples and trial & error with the current information we have and come up with a hypothesis before going back to my manager or client for clarification. I was working on the Manulife Audit where I was modelling a Par and ILP product. There was a lot of trouble with the ILP product because they modelled it using AXIS. They had to make a lot of weird adjustments in the way the calculated the non-unit reserve. Their documentation was also unclear or missing information, so we had a lot of trouble with it. I had to reverse engineer the model based on their illustration and what we were given, completely reworking the existing template that we had. Based on what I had created, then we went back to them to double confirm the approach, rather than waiting for them to come back to us with a detailed response. 2.3 Income - Capital Management \u00b6 This was my second life internship, so I was trusted to take on more intermediate topics like RBC2 . My role on the team was to conduct & improve the Business As Usual (BAU) tasks to generate the monthy/quarterly report to MAS so that my colleagues could focus on other pressing tasks at the time - MAS Inspection and Stress Test. 2.3a Income Key Project - BAU Optimization \u00b6 My main takeaway from the internship was learning how an insurance company operates . At EY, the tasks were one off. As such, it did not matter how we got it done, as long as the end product was acceptable. At Income, we needed to report figures to MAS every month/quarter. Naturally, most of these processes would have been automated to some extent. However, with automation, the how it gets done becomes important. Having been around for many years, Income has already had the necessary infrastructure to support the process - so the next step was to optimize it. In order to improve the system, we must first understand it . Thus, I took the time to read through the RBC2 regulation, figure out what needed to be submitted and how the company operates to get that information. Overall, I came out of it with a strong foundation of the RBC2 regulation and how an Insurance Company operates. 2.4 Zurich - GI Reporting \u00b6 This is my first GI actuarial internship - so I spent a lot of time on my own learning about the different terminology and concepts used in the industry. As the team was extremely small (2 people), we didn't have a single project to work on throughout but rather whatever needed to be done at the time (which was a lot!). 2.4a Zurich Key Project - BAU \u00b6 Zurich Singapore is an extremely young business unit. Although they have had business since 2008, they only had an actuarial team based here in around 2017. Unlike Income, Zurich did not have a lot of the necesary infrastructure in place - especially with a lot changes like RBC2/IFRS17/Group Policy. A lot of the work was thus to build these processes from scratch . It involved pulling data from different sources, manipulating it to get the requirements and then checking against the original source data to see if it reconciles. It is very low level work but the upside was that I got to better familiarize myself with all the concepts and terminology using in General Insurance - Paid, Case, IBNR, Assumed, Retroceded etc. One of the projects I was working on was for IFRS17 where I helped to create a script to calculate Insurance Revenue rather than the traditional Earned Premium that was used for many years. 3. General Questions \u00b6 3.1 Why do you want to work in Actuarial Science? \u00b6 The main reason is because I felt that actuarial science provided me with a very clear and defined career path - take exams, work in insurance, learn insurance regulation; no need to stress about where! 3.2 Why do you want to work in this line of Insurance? \u00b6 Having had the opportunity to intern on both sides, I do have some slight opinions on it: Life Insurance is a very established field with many of the concepts already ironed out, allowing me to gain a depth of experience in the field. However, it may get repetitive and boring after awhile as nothing changes. General Insurance is an evolving field with many new risks and concepts, allowing me to gain a breadth of experience in the field. However, it is difficult to become an expert in any one field. But my experiences as an intern probably only scratched the surface of the what each of them would end up doing - either way what is important is that I am open to learning new things! 3.3 Why do you want to work in this type of company? \u00b6 Having had the opportunity to intern on both sides, I do have some slight opinions on it: Consulting allows me to work on a variety of projects, gaining a strong understanding of the big picture in the industry. However, my understanding of each function will not be as in depth. Direct allows me to go in depth into a specific function, becoming an expert in it. However, this makes it difficult to understand how the industry operates as I only have a limited view. But I think either way regardless of where it is very dependent on your attitude - you can go to consulting and learn nothing or can go to direct and learn a lot! 3.3a Small vs Large Companies \u00b6 Smaller Companies provide the opportunity to do a greater variety of work and gain more experience. Larger Companies provides resources and expertise to learn more 3.4 Career Apirations \u00b6 Short term > Fellow, try out all functions within the field Long term > Move closer to the business 3.

As much as we would like to have full control over our lives, every activity has some dependency on some uncertain factors that are beyond our control. This could possibly lead to unexpected events that changes the value of our assets, for better or for worse. These events would thus cause a difference in value of our internally expected value and the actually realized value of the assets. In the unfortunate case that it would lead to a loss of value , then this possibility of financial loss is known as Risk . Insurance is the transfer of the uncertain financial loss (risk) from one entity to another, in exchange for certain smaller payments to the entity that takes on the risk. The entity transferring the risk is known as the Insured . The entity bearing the risk is known as the Insurer . The certain smaller payments are known as Premiums . When the Insured experiences financial loss, they can make a Claim from the Insurer to be compensated for the loss. From the perspective of the Insured, Insurance helps to exchange a larger uncertain loss for a smaller certain loss, thereby reducing their uncertainty . This is why Insurance is known as the business of uncertainty , as the demand and supply for insurance depend on it: If the Insured knows for certain that an event would not occur , then they would not demand insurance. If the Insurer knows for certain that the event would occur , then they would not supply insurance. It is because there is uncertainty present that there is a market for insurance. Insurance is just one of the ways of managing uncertainty/risk. It would be good to have a working understanding about alternatives, but that is currently out of scope for this set of notes. The details of an insurance agreement between two entities is formally expressed within a contract known as a Insurance Policy . The duration which the insurance policy is valid is known as the Policy Term . Ammendments to the policy (Addittion, Removal or Modification of coverage) can be made through an Endorsement/Rider . Types of Insurance Policies \u00b6 We can categorize insurance policies in many ways. The most common classification is based on the type of risk they insure against: Life Insurance General Insurance Risks related to human life or health All other material risks not related to human life or health Mortality, Longevity & Morbidity Risk Property Losses, Liability Losses or Workers Compensations Long term policies (>3 years) Short term policies (~1 year) Note that some may add a third category - Health Insurance . However, in many countries it is grouped under either of the two. In the UK, it is grouped with General Insurance while in the US it is grouped with Life insurance. For the purposes of this guide, we consider it as its own category of insurance and will be covered more extensively in its own section. There are many specific kinds of policies under each category that will be further explored in their respective section. Alternatively, they may also be classified based on who purchases the insurance: Personal Insurance Commercial Insurance Purchased by individuals Purchased by businesses Auto Insurance More regulated Less regulated Commercial Insurance is less regulated as businesses are generally better equipped to look after their own interests - having the resources to obtain professionals to determine if an insurance policy is suitable for them. Most individuals do not have the resources to do so and thus require laws to protect them . Lastly, it can also be classified based on who provides the insurance: Private Insurance Social Insurance Provided by businesses Provided by the government People have to actively purchase it Citizens are automatically enrolled in it Goal of being Equitable Goal of Income Redistribution Private Insurance that is compulsory to purchase (EG. Auto Insurance) is often confused with social insurance since both are related to the government. However, they are still provided for by different parties and should be treated differently under this classification. Why Insurance \u00b6 From the beginning of human civilization we have sought to reduce uncertainty/risk this was the basis of forming clans, tribes and other groups The group helps their loss fortunate members in times of crisis, which reduces the volatility of access to resources The concept has not changed - we still engage in activity today that involves as acting in a group - employer, government or insurance firm etc In some ways, we are even more vulnerable than our ancestors The resources that used to be provided for by the tribe is reduced Need a more formalized way to reduce ris Why should you get insurance? \u2022 Unexpected things happen at unexpected times with unexpected consequences \u2022 An effective way to handle this risk it to transfer it to someone else \u2192 Insurance o From a behavioural economics perspective, most individuals are Risk Averse \u2013 Concave Utility function o They would much rather prefer a fixed payment rather than an uncertain loss, which is why they would choose to use insurance Why is Insurance Important for the economy? \u2022 All activities entail some level of risk \u2013 Especially those that keep our society running o Without insurance, people would be wearier of these risks and thus engage in these activities much less frequently, slowing down societal growth \u2022 Most of the time, the risks faced are huge \u2013 Car accidents, House fires, worker injury etc o Without insurance, you would have to set aside a large amount of capital to be able to pay off these potential liabilities at any moment, reducing the amount of capital that is spent to spur and drive the economy o Even if you were to save or invest your own capital, these potential losses could pile up into insane amounts which most people will never be able to reach \u2022 If insurers start to fall and people lose trust in the insurance system, it could threaten the stability of our economy, as seen in the 2008 Financial Crisis. There is why the insurance sector was deemed to be of Systemic Risk and AIG was \u201cToo big to Fail\u201d","title":"**Insurance Overview**"},{"location":"Archive/2_Insurance/1_Insurance_Overview/#insurance-overview","text":"","title":"Insurance Overview"},{"location":"Archive/2_Insurance/1_Insurance_Overview/#understanding-insurance","text":"From an economic perspective, every individual owns several assets (wealth, health, wisdom etc) over their life cycle that they must manage to survive, which can be measured through their financial value .

However, in many countries it is grouped under either of the two. In the UK, it is grouped with General Insurance while in the US it is grouped with Life insurance. For the purposes of this guide, we consider it as its own category of insurance and will be covered more extensively in its own section. There are many specific kinds of policies under each category that will be further explored in their respective section. Alternatively, they may also be classified based on who purchases the insurance: Personal Insurance Commercial Insurance Purchased by individuals Purchased by businesses Auto Insurance More regulated Less regulated Commercial Insurance is less regulated as businesses are generally better equipped to look after their own interests - having the resources to obtain professionals to determine if an insurance policy is suitable for them. Most individuals do not have the resources to do so and thus require laws to protect them . Lastly, it can also be classified based on who provides the insurance: Private Insurance Social Insurance Provided by businesses Provided by the government People have to actively purchase it Citizens are automatically enrolled in it Goal of being Equitable Goal of Income Redistribution Private Insurance that is compulsory to purchase (EG. Auto Insurance) is often confused with social insurance since both are related to the government. However, they are still provided for by different parties and should be treated differently under this classification.","title":"Types of Insurance Policies"},{"location":"Archive/2_Insurance/1_Insurance_Overview/#why-insurance","text":"From the beginning of human civilization we have sought to reduce uncertainty/risk this was the basis of forming clans, tribes and other groups The group helps their loss fortunate members in times of crisis, which reduces the volatility of access to resources The concept has not changed - we still engage in activity today that involves as acting in a group - employer, government or insurance firm etc In some ways, we are even more vulnerable than our ancestors The resources that used to be provided for by the tribe is reduced Need a more formalized way to reduce ris Why should you get insurance? \u2022 Unexpected things happen at unexpected times with unexpected consequences \u2022 An effective way to handle this risk it to transfer it to someone else \u2192 Insurance o From a behavioural economics perspective, most individuals are Risk Averse \u2013 Concave Utility function o They would much rather prefer a fixed payment rather than an uncertain loss, which is why they would choose to use insurance Why is Insurance Important for the economy? \u2022 All activities entail some level of risk \u2013 Especially those that keep our society running o Without insurance, people would be wearier of these risks and thus engage in these activities much less frequently, slowing down societal growth \u2022 Most of the time, the risks faced are huge \u2013 Car accidents, House fires, worker injury etc o Without insurance, you would have to set aside a large amount of capital to be able to pay off these potential liabilities at any moment, reducing the amount of capital that is spent to spur and drive the economy o Even if you were to save or invest your own capital, these potential losses could pile up into insane amounts which most people will never be able to reach \u2022 If insurers start to fall and people lose trust in the insurance system, it could threaten the stability of our economy, as seen in the 2008 Financial Crisis.

This allows the financial loss (which would have been disastrous for a single insured) to be spread among the group , becoming manageable for all. Consider a simple example to illustrate the concept: There are 10 people inside the risk pool, each with a potential risk of $100. We know for sure that 1 out of the 10 people will experience this $100 loss the next year. If someone experiences a loss, then everyone within the pool will fork out $10 each. This forms the $100 needed to cover the 1 unlucky person who experiences the $100 loss. No matter whether an individual experiences the loss or not, they only end up paying $10 to the pool . An insurance company helps to make the process more efficient by collecting the amount to be paid by each person beforehand (premiums) and then paying out the full amount to the unlucky individual shortly after the loss occurs. This also avoids the potential problem of someone not willing to pay their share. This assumes that each risk in the pool statistically independent of one another, where it is extremely unlikely that a large portion of the insureds in the pool will make a claim at at the same time. This allows the insurer to collect a fixed and relatively low premium from every single insured and use them to pay only the small portion of insureds that makes a claim. Law of Large Numbers \u00b6 Another key assumption of risk pooling is that the insurer knows the Frequency and Severity of the loss, thus knowing the risk of the insured. \\[ \\displaylines{ Risk = Frequency * Severity \\\\ Expected~Loss = Probability~of~Loss * Amount~of~Loss } \\] Unlike determining the probability of a fair dice throw, there is no intuitive logic that can be used to derive these two values. Thus, the insurer needs to estimate them from historical data - from publicly available studies or their own studies on their insureds. These estimates are formally known as Assumptions . The actual values are known as the Experience of the insurer. If the insurer has a sufficiently large pool of statistically independent insureds , then through the Law of Large Numbers , the estimated loss will be close to the actual loss of the group. This is because in a sufficiently large group, on average , the positive and negative deviations will offset one another, leaving the estimate to be close to experience . Thus, the estimates can be used to reasonably predict the actual losses from the pool of poliyholders, allowing the insurance company to calculate an adequate premium to maintain the risk pool. In practice, most insurers also include premium provisions for other expenses and/or a profit margin. Through Risk Pooling and the Law of Large numbers, unpredictable individual risk becomes predictable pooled risk . This is identical to the concept of Portfolio Diversification in finance, where the Non-Systematic Risks (EG. An individual house catches fire) of the insureds are removed by pooling them together. The insurer still faces some level of Systematic Risk that cannot be pooled away (EG. Asteroid hits earth and destroys all houses), but this is significantly smaller than any of the individual risks, which is why the insurer is willing to take on the risks of many. Reserves \u00b6 The law of large numbers only guarantees that the derived probability will always be true on average , over multiple events. There could be times where the derived probability is different from the true probability, leading to differences between the actual and expected losses for the insurer. Since the insurer collects premiums to cover for only the expected losses, a larger than expected loss in one particular year would mean that the insurer requires additional capital to pay off the claims. Thus, insurers are required to set aside a Reserve for their policies, where they can draw upon in times of larger than expected loss. The reserve is meant to supplement the collected premiums in situations where the premiums were insufficient, to ensure that the insurer will be able to fulfil their claims, even in the unlikely event of larger than expected losses. Insurers simulate these larger than expected losses by shocking the assumptions used. The shock is often referred to as a Margin for Adverse Deviation and is typically determined by the insurer. Low Margin High Margin Lower simulated loss Higher simulated loss Lower reserve held Larger reserve held Lower opportunity cost Higher opportunity cost May not be able to fulfil claims Should be able to fulfil claims Each country has their own set of specific regulations on how the reserves should be calculated and how much capital must be actually held, which will be covered in their own respective sections. Asymmetric Information \u00b6 The biggest problem in the insurance industry comes from Asymmetric Information - a situation where one party has more information than the other party, allowing one side to take advantage of it, to the other's detriment. In insurance context, the two parties are the Seller (Insurance Company) and the Buyer (insured). Each side has little incentive to disclose any additional negative information that they have. Buyer Ignorance \u00b6 The most understood form of asymmetry is known as Buyer Ignorance , where the seller has more information as compared to the buyer. This is detrimental to the buyer as they end up buying a product that appears good but is actually defective (Lemon) in some manner that the seller was aware of, but not the buyer. This occurred because of the Ignorance of the Buyer , who was unable to identify the defects. The average person would not be able to properly assess the value of an insurance policy or the financial health of the insurance company due to complicated nature of the product and the inconsistent jargon used across the industry. This could result in them purchasing less desirable policies that they otherwise would not have. This is the reason why the insurance industry is heavily regulated across the globe - in order to level the playing field and combat buyer ignorance. For instance, regulators constantly monitor the financial health of insurance companies to ensure that they are solvent and require certain kinds of insurance to be purchased through a representative that will explain the terms of the contract. Moral Hazard \u00b6 Moral Hazard refers to a situation where the buyer has more information as compared to the seller. After being insured, insureds have an incentive to engage in riskier behavior relative to before they were insured. This is because sine they do not have to bear the cost of the actions , they become less careful and engage in riskier behaviour that they otherwise would not have before. Ex Ante - Changes Loss Prevention behaviour; EG. Driving more recklessly, increasing the Frequency of accidents Ex Post - Changes Loss Minimization behaviour; EG. Increasing the scope of car repairs, increasing the Severity of accidents The effect is that this increases the frequencies and/or severities of the losses after the insurance contract has been made, which means that the premiums charged are not sufficient to cover the higher expected losses as a result of the moral hazard. This forces the insurer to increase premiums for all insureds to account for the increased losses due to the behaviour of a few. There are four mechanisms to work around moral hazard, ensuring that there is no incentive to engage in riskier behaviour: Insurable Interest - The insured must have some significant relation to what is being insured. They should benefit MORE from the insured event NOT occuring rather than occurring. Indemnity - Insurance should compensate for a loss, returning the insured back to their original position before the loss. The insured should not be left better off after an insurance claim Contribution - If the insured owns multiple policies , then each policy will only compensate a portion of the amount, with the total equivalent to the loss. This is to ensure that the insured cannot seek compensation more than once; cannot be left better off after the insured event Subrogation - If the insured experienced loss as a result of a third party, they forfeit the legal right to seek compensation from the third party. This is to ensure that the insured cannot seek compensation more than once; cannot be left better off after the insured event Additionally, they could introduce an element of responsibility on the insureds end by introducing one or more cost sharing mechanisms : Co-payments - A fixed amount that must be paid for by the insured Deductible - A fixed amount of the remaining claim that must be paid for by the insured Co-insurance - Proportion of the remaining claim that must be paid for by the insured Claim limits - Maximum amount that the insurer will cover in a single claim or over a period; excess is paid for by the insured Insureds typically have an option if they would like to have these cost sharing mechanisms in their policy. Naturally, policies with cost sharings have lower premiums than those without as they minimize moral hazard. Adverse Selection \u00b6 Adverse Selection refers to a situation where the buyer has more information as compared to the seller. Due to the nature of insurance, it often attracts more high risk insureds than low risk ones. This results in the risk pool being systematically biased towards high risk insureds, causing the average claims experience to be higher than that of a randomly selected group, to the insurers detriment as they are not charging enough premiums . Thus, there is a natural selection of high risk insureds to join the pool, leading to adverse outcomes for insurers. This occurs because the insurer does not have enough information about the insured to distinguish between high and low risk ones. Thus, high risk insureds have an incentive to NOT disclose their additional information (to be charged lower), misrepresenting their risk profile. This means that high risk and low risk insureds will be the paying the same premium. However, the higher risk individuals are underpaying relative to the risk they add to the pool while lower risk insureds are overpaying relative to the risk they add to the pool. The low risk insureds are essentially subsidising the higher risk ones, which is unfair to them. This causes actual losses to be consistently larger than the expected loss (which they priced for), causing the insurer lose money over time. This would force the insurer to increase premiums to compensate for the loss, prompting genuinely low risk insureds to leave the pool as they will realise thay are overpaying for their insurance. This further worsens the problem, as they recieve even lesser premiums than before, experiencing an even larger loss, increasing premiums once more. Eventually, the premiums are so high that no one will be willing to buy insurance anymore , causing the system to fail. The most natural way to work around this is to obtain more information about the prospective insured to properly assess their risk. insureds will then be charged a premium proportional to the level of risk that they bring, overcoming the effects of adverse selection. This process is formally known as Underwriting , which will be covered in greater detail in the next section. Alternatively, if it was mandatory to have the insurance, then low risk individuals cannot drop out of the pool, allowing the insurer to charge a higher premium without the system failing. A similar effect can also be achieved by offering Group Insurance , which typically consists of a good mix of high and low risk individuals. Insurance paradox - if you want insurance, is damn suspicious EG. Why you want? Is it you suddenly find out u got critical illness? Underwriting \u00b6 To underwrite a policy is to guarantee that the terms of the insurance policy will be upheld. This definition is similar to the finance definition, where the a financial institution underwrites a share issuance, guaranteeing that all shares will be sold (by purchasing unsold ones themselves). In the insurance specific context, Underwriting is a screening process of determining the risk of a prospective insured and charging them a premium proportional to the determined level of risk, excluding them from certain coverage or refusing to underwrite the policy totally. Essentially, the insurer price discriminates insureds based on their level of risk, with the goal of detecting and detering adverse selection . The screening process typically involves the requesting information relevant to the risk and their supporting documents. Insurance contracts are legally bound by the principle of Utmost Good Faith , which means that both parties must enter the contract in good faith - without the ill intention of deceiving the other. If it was found that the insured withheld material information (intentionally or not) from the insurer, the insurer thus has the right to void the policy and remove its obligation to pay out the claim. Insurers then place the insured into one of various Risk Classifications that are based on Demographic Factors (Age, Gender, Smoking Status) or other relevant Individual Factors . Using these characteristics, insurers estimate the risk of a typical insured within the class. Using the estimates and the desired level of coverage, an appropriate level of premium is calculated. In an ideal world, the insurer would like to precisely determine the risk of the insured. However, it is often hard to obtain the necessary information to do so because the insured would not disclose it, does not know about it or the necessary information simply does not exist. Thus, the risk classification provides an as precise as possible estimation of the risk, but it is not guaranteed to be perfect. For instance, smokers are statistically more vulnerable to developing certain types of Cancers. However, a particular smoker may have a genertic pre-disposition that prevents him from developing cancer. Since this information is usually inaccessible, the smoker will be charged according to the general trend. Risk classifications are more accurate when there is more data available about the risk . As such, classifications for personal insurance tend to be extremely accurate as every individual experience similar risks. Conversely, commercial insurance classifications are not as accurate as the risks that each business faces is different from one another, thus cannot be used to accurately predict losses. Thus, commerical premiums may be significantly different from the risk classifications, as the underwriter may exercise their professional judgment to adjust the premiums based on their perceived risk of the insured (subject to various company level underwriting guidelines). There is a trade off in Underwriting when it comes to high risk insureds. On one hand there is an inherent desire to write more business , which can be done by lowering premiums to incentivise them to take go forward with the insurance policy. On the other hand, a high risk insured below the required premiums adds unnecessary risk to the pool. The tension between these two goals is especially strong because high risk does not necessarily translate to actual losses. However, insurance is one of the few industries where they can earn more by selling less , thus it is generally safer to write fewer risky accounts (earning less in premiums) than many risky accounts (earning more in premiums), as the long run claims typically have a greater impact than premiums. How Insurance makes money \u00b6 Timing Problem \u00b6 Most traditional companies know the cost of their product before the sell it. For instance, a phone manufacturer knows exactly how much it costs to produce a phone, thus they know that the difference in their price and cost is the amount they will make or lose. Insurance Financials \u2022 Insurance companies operate very differently from a traditional company - They collect Revenue (Premiums) BEFORE knowing the Cost (Claims) of their products \u2022 Since they may eventually have to pay out a claim, they cannot recognize these premiums as profits or freely use the capital they have gained \u2022 They have to hold enough liquid capital in order to pay off potential future claims. This amount is known as the Reserves, determined by the actuarial department o \u2022 Companies can only recognize profit (Accounting sense) from insurance through a release of reserves. Reserves are typically conservative (Larger than what they expect to pay). Thus, if the actual experience reserves are lower than the reserve, the excess can be recognized as profit for the company \u2022 Standard accounting principles state that revenues and expenses must match the period in which they were recognised \u2013 but insurance is different. Thus, they have to follow a special set of accounting rules \u2013 IFRS17 How do Insurance Companies make money? Investment Income \u2022 The main way they make money is through Investments. As stated earlier, there is a significant time gap between when premiums are paid and when a potential claim is made, if any at all. Insurers can invest the money during this time to generate revenue o Capital set aside as part of the reserves can only be invested in less risky assets such as Government Bonds or high-grade Corporate Bonds, which naturally yields a lower return o Remaining capital can be invested freely according to the insurer\u2019s appetite in other asset classes as well (Equities etc) o Therefore, setting the reserves is so important \u2013 too high a reserve limits the investment capital while too low may put the company in financial distress \u2022 Therefore, insurance is known as a capital business \u2013 They obtain capital via Insurance Contracts for investments. Insurance contracts are a special form of Debt, thus this whole process of investment is akin to the concept of Financial Leverage \u2022 The competitive advantage of using insurance policies is that unlike regular debt, there is no fixed maturity date (if any at all) and no fixed redemption value (if any at all). But this is also the same reasons insurers are prone to financial distress o Thus, we can think of Insurance as a highly leveraged business o Berkshire Hathaway is a great example. Warren Buffet is known for his great investments, but not many realise that his investment capital comes from the insurance and reinsurance wing of Berkshire Hathaway \u2022 This is still a very high-level understanding of the process \u2013 it is actually a very complex process with only a few strategic personnel knowing how it works Underwriting Profit \u2022 Another way that they can earn money is through Underwriting Profit \u2013 the difference between the premiums collected and what is paid out in claims and expenses \u2022 Most people believe that this is the main way that insurers make money given that this is what most consumers are exposed to. This idea is also perpetuated because of the misguided notion that insurers deny claims to increase profit \u2022 However, for many lines of insurance, the UW profit is often small, if not negative Overview of Life Insurance \u00b6 Death is inevitable - Instead of focusing on if the policyholder will die, it is focused on when they will die Life is immeasurable - Instead of indemnity, it provides a pre-specified amount chosen by the insured, known as the Sum Assured (SA) Insured is dead - Instead of paying out to the insured, the payout is given to an appointed individual , known as the Beneficiary Thus, Life Insurance is a contract where the Insurer pays the Death Benefit (Equal to the Sum Assured) to the appointed Beneficiary upon the death of the insured.","title":"**Insurance Concepts**"},{"location":"Archive/2_Insurance/2_Insurance_Concepts/#insurance-concepts","text":"","title":"Insurance Concepts"},{"location":"Archive/2_Insurance/2_Insurance_Concepts/#how-insurance-works","text":"","title":"How Insurance works"},{"location":"Archive/2_Insurance/2_Insurance_Concepts/#risk-pooling","text":"Insurers are willing to take on the risk of the insured because if they can take on the risk of other insureds, they can pool the risks together .

There is a trade off in Underwriting when it comes to high risk insureds. On one hand there is an inherent desire to write more business , which can be done by lowering premiums to incentivise them to take go forward with the insurance policy. On the other hand, a high risk insured below the required premiums adds unnecessary risk to the pool. The tension between these two goals is especially strong because high risk does not necessarily translate to actual losses. However, insurance is one of the few industries where they can earn more by selling less , thus it is generally safer to write fewer risky accounts (earning less in premiums) than many risky accounts (earning more in premiums), as the long run claims typically have a greater impact than premiums.","title":"Underwriting"},{"location":"Archive/2_Insurance/2_Insurance_Concepts/#how-insurance-makes-money","text":"","title":"How Insurance makes money"},{"location":"Archive/2_Insurance/2_Insurance_Concepts/#timing-problem","text":"Most traditional companies know the cost of their product before the sell it. For instance, a phone manufacturer knows exactly how much it costs to produce a phone, thus they know that the difference in their price and cost is the amount they will make or lose. Insurance Financials \u2022 Insurance companies operate very differently from a traditional company - They collect Revenue (Premiums) BEFORE knowing the Cost (Claims) of their products \u2022 Since they may eventually have to pay out a claim, they cannot recognize these premiums as profits or freely use the capital they have gained \u2022 They have to hold enough liquid capital in order to pay off potential future claims. This amount is known as the Reserves, determined by the actuarial department o \u2022 Companies can only recognize profit (Accounting sense) from insurance through a release of reserves. Reserves are typically conservative (Larger than what they expect to pay). Thus, if the actual experience reserves are lower than the reserve, the excess can be recognized as profit for the company \u2022 Standard accounting principles state that revenues and expenses must match the period in which they were recognised \u2013 but insurance is different. Thus, they have to follow a special set of accounting rules \u2013 IFRS17 How do Insurance Companies make money? Investment Income \u2022 The main way they make money is through Investments. As stated earlier, there is a significant time gap between when premiums are paid and when a potential claim is made, if any at all. Insurers can invest the money during this time to generate revenue o Capital set aside as part of the reserves can only be invested in less risky assets such as Government Bonds or high-grade Corporate Bonds, which naturally yields a lower return o Remaining capital can be invested freely according to the insurer\u2019s appetite in other asset classes as well (Equities etc) o Therefore, setting the reserves is so important \u2013 too high a reserve limits the investment capital while too low may put the company in financial distress \u2022 Therefore, insurance is known as a capital business \u2013 They obtain capital via Insurance Contracts for investments. Insurance contracts are a special form of Debt, thus this whole process of investment is akin to the concept of Financial Leverage \u2022 The competitive advantage of using insurance policies is that unlike regular debt, there is no fixed maturity date (if any at all) and no fixed redemption value (if any at all). But this is also the same reasons insurers are prone to financial distress o Thus, we can think of Insurance as a highly leveraged business o Berkshire Hathaway is a great example. Warren Buffet is known for his great investments, but not many realise that his investment capital comes from the insurance and reinsurance wing of Berkshire Hathaway \u2022 This is still a very high-level understanding of the process \u2013 it is actually a very complex process with only a few strategic personnel knowing how it works Underwriting Profit \u2022 Another way that they can earn money is through Underwriting Profit \u2013 the difference between the premiums collected and what is paid out in claims and expenses \u2022 Most people believe that this is the main way that insurers make money given that this is what most consumers are exposed to. This idea is also perpetuated because of the misguided notion that insurers deny claims to increase profit \u2022 However, for many lines of insurance, the UW profit is often small, if not negative","title":"Timing Problem"},{"location":"Archive/2_Insurance/2_Insurance_Concepts/#overview-of-life-insurance","text":"Death is inevitable - Instead of focusing on if the policyholder will die, it is focused on when they will die Life is immeasurable - Instead of indemnity, it provides a pre-specified amount chosen by the insured, known as the Sum Assured (SA) Insured is dead - Instead of paying out to the insured, the payout is given to an appointed individual , known as the Beneficiary Thus, Life Insurance is a contract where the Insurer pays the Death Benefit (Equal to the Sum Assured) to the appointed Beneficiary upon the death of the insured.","title":"Overview of Life Insurance"},{"location":"Archive/2_Insurance/3_Insurance_Stakeholders/","text":"Insurance Stakeholders \u00b6 Overall Workflow \u2022 Actuaries create insurance policies, determining how much premiums the company will need to charge and how much of those premiums it needs to set aside for related claims \u2022 Insurance Agents market this policy to prospective clients OR Insurance Brokers with interested clients approach the company to enquire about the policy \u2022 Underwriters assess the risk of the client and decides on the extent of coverage to offer and how much premium to charge \u2022 Loss Adjustors are engaged during a claim process to verify the validity of the claim \u2013decide if a pay-out is warranted and if so, how much \u2022 Other administrative staff are also involved throughout the process Actuaries \u00b6 Actuaries \u2022 Traditional actuarial functions are in Pricing, Reserving/Valuation, Experience Analysis or Financial Reporting of a portfolio of policies o In simple terms, Actuaries help to ensure that the enough money is being charged and set aside in adherence to the regulatory environment \u2022 Non-traditional areas in the more corporate finance/data science side of things are beginning to involve more Actuaries as well \u2013 Asset Liability Management, Enterprise Risk Modelling etc \u2022 We will explore these roles in more detail in a later section Intermediaries \u00b6 Intermediaries o Agents are sales representatives tied to the company and hence can only sell their companies policies.

Because underwriting is about discriminating individuals for the sake of efficiency, it may contravene antidiscrimination legislation, espe- cially when the classification matches with the membership to historically disadvantaged groups (in terms of opportunities, resources, welfare, etc.) in order to impose differentiated premiums to the members of such groups, higher than those paid by the members of other, more historically advantaged, groups. Underwriting practices, which address adverse selection, may be seen as discriminatory or unjust while trying to guarantee or to maximize effi- ciency, insurers create situations that contravene moral intuitions about justice and fairness. To answer your question, insurance companies will invest the pool of money they recieve from premium payments into what are known as Mutual Funds, which are investment funds aimed at reaching a fixed or benchmark rate of return, with this rate of return structured so as to compensate the insurance company for the risk from the policies they issue that cant be removed through diversification of their portfolio. Then why not extend this segmentation by classifying people according to family history of disease or genetics, for instance? Because, currently, it is not easy to segment the population in this way, and there may not be a large enough difference in mortality rates to justify the expense of segmentation. There will also certainly be political and social resistance to this degree of segmentation, since it will be viewed as an invasion of privacy and discrimination. Of course, basing life insurance premiums on sex and smoking status can also be viewed as discriminatory, but it has a sound actuarial basis. However, sex and smoking status, unlike family history or genetics, are easily observable traits, and, thus, cannot be considered an invasion of privacy. Nonetheless, as technology advances, segmentation based on genetics will be attempted. While many view it as discriminatory, others will argue, and rightly so, that to not allow it would force others to subsidize the premiums of others. Since insurance rates are determined by the death rate of the insured, including people with a higher death rate at the same premium would make the premium higher for all. As with the different rates for sex and smoking status, companies will offer better rates to those willing to show their good genetic profiles, which, in turn, will cause adverse selection for the other companies not using genetics, forcing them either to raise their premiums for all or to start using genetic profiles as well. Insurance Trends Insuretech \u2022 It refers to technology that are meant to make the insurance industry more efficient \u2022 Tech company that connects to the insurance world, not the other way round \u2022 According to OW, there are three types of insuretech to varying degrees (Seen below) \u2022 Insuretech represents innovation in the industry \u2013 which is commonly thrown around as a buzzword \u2022 Should companies rush towards insuretech? The answer is simple \u2013 only if it is profitable to do so, not just for the sake of getting new technology Distribution Based Insuretech \u2022 Most people are consumers of Insurance. Thus, the most common forms of Insuretech they would see are Distribution based \u2013 Lemonade, Hippo Insurance etc. \u2022 Taking Lemonade as an example, they use technology to help underwrite products without the need for an intermediary or underwriter, saving on these costs (~25%) o But are they truly making money? o Depending on how they choose to treat R&D (One-time expense VS Amortize) the numbers could look very different \u2013 hard to offset large R&D costs o It is reported that even till today these companies are still making losses \u2022 Will these distribution based insuretech take over? While some consumers are glad to be able to save costs by going direct, others (especially less knowledgeable ones) prefer to have an expert explain it to them and help them plan rather than taking time off their already busy lives to stress about it \u2022 In the most extreme case, it is predicted that we will no longer have any intermediaries in the future \u2013 Given your data, AI will assess your background and prompt you to increase your coverage etc o In terms of Life insurance, given that there are no more commissions, this will encourage policyholders to buy additional savings o However, the problem with this is about getting the data into the system as well as regulatory concerns \u2013 still need an FA for investment products, Data laws etc Big Data/Machine Learning \u2022 As technology becomes advanced and integrated into our lives, companies will have much more data to work with to determine how to price us, especially with newer cutting-edge machine learning techniques \u2022 At the centre of it all is the use Telematics \u2013 technology that can be used to directly collect data. Currently, it mainly refers to Car Telematics, but other similar devices already exist such as the Apple Watch or other lifestyle tracking devices \u2022 These telematic devices will be used to collect more precise data which can then be used to properly rate the policy. Some ethical concerns have been raised about whether insurers have the right to these data \u2013 but studies have shown that most consumers do not mind giving up this data if it can lead to lower premiums \u2022 However, pricing premiums too accurately could threaten the risk pool. Regulators may step in, but it will definitely be some time before that happens as legislation always lags behind technological development \u2022 An alternative way we can see this happening is when Insurance begins to move in-house \u2013 EG. Tesla & Shopee. These companies will know more about the risk than a third-party insurer, thus they can more accurately price premiums, allowing them to be more competitive than traditional insurers Rise of Specialty Insurance \u2022 A smaller trend would be the development of new kinds of products \u2013 Pet Insurance, Drone Insurance & Cyber insurance to name a few \u2022 We should expect even more products to match changes in societal norms over time SNACK by income > Micro insurance to build up insurance covderage in small amounts and offer rebates from spending In the form insurance coverage Tribe by Income > Netflix subscription style insurance Singlife Digital ILP > Monitor and track ILP performance Prudential PULSE > Provides access to healthcare services, telemedicine SGfindex > Could include insurance coverage as well Insurance Market in Singapore Life Insurance VS General Insurance Size \u2022 Life Insurance market is larger than General in Singapore. This is the opposite of larger nations like the US, where the General Insurance sector is (slightly) larger \u2022 Naturally, this means that there is a greater demand for GI actuaries in other countries \u2022 Larger number of policyholders means that they have more data/experience to use for more complex statistical methods (Machine Learning), warranting higher pay there \u2022 Thus, the advice is to stick to Life Insurance if you want to stay in SG or do GI if you want the opportunity to work overseas in the future Why Life is bigger in Singapore? \u2022 Seems a bit counter-intuitive at first because the number of Lives is limited while Cars/Corporations are not \u2013 but do they really outnumber people? (Nope) \u2022 Another reason could be due to the Saving/Investment component of Life Insurance \u2013 there is no limit to the amount you can choose to put into it. Coupled with the Asian mindset, this leads to larger premiums for Life o The Asian mindset may push them to prefer products where they can at least take access some cash value at any time \u2013 \u201ctangible\u201d o Additionally, they may also prefer the ability to pass on some wealth to the next generation or relieve their burden (Opposite of Western) Why Life is smaller in other countries? \u2022 Other countries naturally have a larger population size \u2013 more things to insure, making General Insurance naturally much larger \u2022 Another aspect to consider is the regulation surrounding Life Insurance \u2013 the Savings/Investment aspect of policies there might be structured differently which may push people to invest on their own or in their pension rather than Life Insurance Life Insurance Landscape \uf0a7 SG has a small but developed population \u2013 most would already own a Life Insurance from one of the major players (Purchased themselves or via parents) o However, the Protection Gap in SG is much larger than expected \uf0a7 The gameplan for Life Insurance in SG is not to sell as many policies as possible (Not realistic due to limited population) but rather to target up-market with wealth accumulation style policies o This is why smaller & more specialized insurers have continued to exist as they serve expats or other High Net Worth (HNW) clients o Suspected that they could be a front for money laundering as well! \uf0a7 Mainstream companies (Pru, GE, AIA etc) are also beginning to do this with an increasing focus on Investment products etc Mergers and Acquisitions in SG \u2022 2010: Prudential acquired UOB Life \u2022 2018: Singlife acquired Zurich Life \u2022 2020: Singlife acquired Aviva \u2022 2021: HSBC acquired AXA Singapore in the Region \u2022 The biggest competitor to Singapore is Hong Kong \u2013 All financial institutions want to be in Hong Kong to tap into the large Chinese market \u2022 However, HK is still a part of China \u2013 Chinese investors may want to move their investments outside of China completely and will choose Singapore \u2022 Singapore is also a central hub to other HNW individuals within the ASEAN region, which is why we will always remain relevan","title":"Dump"},{"location":"Archive/3_Life_Insurance/10_Par_Fund_Management/","text":"Par fund management","title":"10 Par Fund Management"},{"location":"Archive/3_Life_Insurance/1_Life_Products/","text":"Life Products \u00b6 This section is meant to provide an overview of the key features of the different types of life insurance policies and their common variations. Product Type \u00b6 There are several types of insurance that fall under the \"Life\" category. All of them insure against risks associated with the human life . This section will focus on the key ideas behind each type of product. It is NOT meant to cover the specific mechanics of how each product functions. Note that not all of the product types mentioned below are offered as a standalone product. Some are often combined with regular life insurance or offered as an optional rider to a regular life insurance plan. Life Insurance \u00b6 Life Insurance is a contract whereby the insurer will pay out a benefit to the beneficiary if the policyholder dies or becomes diagnosed with Terminal Illness . Individuals who die earlier than expected leave their dependents (who have yet to become financially independent) without financial support. Thus, life insurance helps to provide: Income Replacement : Replaces the income that would have been earned by the insured; allowing their dependents to maintain their current lifestyle Debt Repayment : Covers outstanding debts of the family (EG. Home Mortgage) There are also expenses associated with death (EG. Hospice, Funeral). The benefit payout can also be used to cover these expenses , ensuring that no financial burden was left onto their family. Total Permanent Disability \u00b6 Total Permanent Disability (TPD) insurance is a contract whereby the insurer will pay a benefit to the insured in the event that they become totally and permanently disabled . Most insurers use the some variation of the below definition for TPD: The inability to engage in any paid work Irrecoverable physical loss - loss of sight in both eyes, loss of two limbs or a loss of sight in one eye and loss of one limb Individuals who have TPD can no longer work . Thus, TPD insurance similarly provides Income replacement and Debt Repayment coverage for the beneficiaries of the insured. They also incur additional expenses that can be covered with the benefit pay out: Medical Expenses : Healthcare costs not covered by Health Insurance (Due to nature of treatment or coverage limit) Non-Medical Expenses : Cost of home modifications or assistive devices to aid living with TPD (EG. Wheelchair ramps or Communication aids) Since the benefit can be used to cover necessary expenses, it ensures that no financial burden falls upon the family of the insured. Additionally, it also preserves their own financial resources , allowing them to be used for their intended purposes (EG. Retirement or Children's Education). Note The above point can be made for all remaining products types that trigger a payout while the insured is still alive. Critical Illness Insurance \u00b6 Critical Illness (CI) Insurance is a contract whereby the insurer will pay out a benefit to the policyholder if they become diagnosed with a qualifying critical illness . In Singapore, there are a list of 37 CIs with a standardized definition across the industry. Insurers are then free to provide coverage for addittional CIs based on their own definitions. Individuals who become diagnosed with critical illness typically become unable to work as they require treatment. Thus, CI insurance similarly provides Income Replacement and Debt Repayment coverage for the beneficiaries of the insured during the downtime. Similar to TPD, CI insurance can cover out of pocket expenses that are not covered by health insurance : Medical Expenses : Alternative therapies for rare variations of illness Non-Medical Expenses : Cost of transport & accomodation for out of town treatments Warning It is a common misconception that CI insurance is needed to cover the cost of treatment - that should be covered by health insurance. However, due to the ever evolving nature of CI and medical technology, some rare diseases or new treatments might not be covered by health insurance. Long Term Care Insurance \u00b6 Long Term Care Insurance is a contract whereby the insurer will make routine payments to the insured for as long as they are Severely Disabled . Most insurers use the following definition for Severe Disability - the inability to INDEPENDENTLY perform one or more Activities of Daily Living (ADL): Individuals who are severely disabled cannot live indepedently and thus require long term care . Thus, the main purpose of LTC insurance is to cover expenses for LTC services such as the cost of assisted living facilities or in-home nursing. Disability Income Insurance \u00b6 Disability Income Insurance is a contract whereby the insurer will make a routine payment to the insured for as long as they are disabled and unable to work due to sickness or injury. There are different definitions of disability, depending on the nature of the job that the insured is unable to perform: Unable to perform current job Unable to perform any job suited to their experience and education Unable to perform any job Warning The are three main types of disability insurance that are commonly confused with one another. One intuitive way to differentiate them is based on the severity of disability covered : Disability - Disability Insurance Severe Disability - Long Term Care Insurance Total Permanent Disability - TPD Insurance Life Annuities \u00b6 A Life Annuity is a contract whereby the insurer will make routine payments to the insured for as long as they are alive during the payment period. Individuals who live longer than expected might not have sufficient financial resources to survive. Thus, the annuity payments are meant to cover essential living expenses , ensuring the insured is able to age gracefully. Info Life annuities are the natural complements to life insurance - one hedges the risk of dying too early while the other against the risk of dying too late. By Premium Payment Term \u00b6 The easiest method of categorizing life insurance policies is via their Premium Payment Term . It refers to how long premiums must be paid to keep the policy active. There are three states that a policy can be in: In-Force - Required premiums have been paid and will remain active till the next premium due date Lapsed - Required premiums have NOT been paid and will become inactive from then on Paid Up - ALL required premiums have been paid and will remain active for the remaining duration of the policy Info There is usually a grace period of about 1 month for the insured to make the required premium payment after the premium due date . Most insurers allow a lapsed policy to be Reinstated within a specified window after it has lapsed. It typically involves paying the outstanding premiums since lapse. However, reinstatement is not guaranteed . Some insurers may require the individual to go through medical underwriting again. In such cases, the terms of the policy may be adjusted if the insured's condition has worsened. Regular Premium (RP) \u00b6 A Regular Premium policy must have premiums paid at regular intervals for the policy to remain in-force. From an Regardless which choice is chosen, the total premiums required are the same from an actuarial perspective . Thus, regular premiums tend to have the smallest magnitude . This option is suited for individuals who have a steady stream of income and are thus able to spread the cost of insurance over an extended period of time. Single Premium (SP) \u00b6 A Single Premium policy only needs to have premium paid once on inception. The policy becomes paid up from that point on. Naturally, single premiums would have the largest magnitude as the entire premium is being paid upfront. This option is suited for individuals with a large amount of liquid assets (typically obtained via a windfall) and are thus able to secure the insurance coverage in a single payment. Limited Pay (LP) \u00b6 A Limited Pay policy is a mixture of the above: Premiums must be paid at regular intervals for a fixed period ; premiums must be paid for the policy to remain in-force during this period After that period, the policy is paid up from that point on Premium size tends to be significantly larger than regular premiums The required period could be defined in two ways: Explicit - Payments required for a fixed number of years (EG. 20 years) Implicit - Payments required till a certain age (EG. Till age 65) This option is suited for individuals who either: Have unreliable streams of income; cannot afford to spread the cost Have high income ; can afford to pay the higher premiums Premium Mode \u00b6 The frequency at which premiums are paid is known as the Premium Mode . For most policies, premiums are to be paid annually by default. However, most insurers offer the option to pay premiums on a more frequent basis instead to suit individuals with different needs - Semi-Annually , Quarterly or Monthly . Generally speaking, premiums paid more frequently have a slightly higher magnitude when compared on the same basis: This is due to reflect the higher cost to accomodate more frequent payments: Opportunity cost of interest due to premiums being received later Higher expenses due to increased billing and processing Warning A common misconception is that paying a higher premium would contribute more to the cash value of the policy. The additional costs are entirely to reflect higher costs; insurers are typically indifferent between payment modes as the amount going to the insurance portion remains the same. By Policy Term \u00b6 Another intuitive method of categorizing life insurance policies is via their Policy Term - how long the insurance coverage will last. Term \u00b6 Term policies offer insurance coverage for a specified period - a fixed number of years or till a specified age. If the insured does not occur during the policy term, then the policy will expire and nothing will be paid out . Thus, it is suited for individuals with financial obligations for a limited period - EG. Till their children become financially independent. Term policies typically have lower premiums due to the following reasons: There is a possibility of not receiving a payout Product features are simpler and easy to compare , making it more price competitive Whole Life \u00b6 Whole Life policies offers permanent coverage for the entire lifetime of the insured. Note Technically speaking, there is an upper limit to the coverage, known as the Maturity Age : It is the age whereby the insurer assumes all individuals will die (EG. Age 120) If the insured survives till this age, then the policy will mature and benefit will be paid out to the insured This is because the product was priced based on the expectation that a payout would be made by this age. Thus, it is only fair that the insurer actually makes the payout Since death is inevitable , the insurer will surely make a payout on the policy. Thus, it is suited for individuals who want to leave a bequest for their beneficiaries. Info Since the death payment is guaranteed , the face amount is referred to as the Sum Assured . This is why this type of policy is also known as a Life Assurance . The defining feature of a whole life policy is that it accumulates capital within the policy (similar to a savings account), known as the Cash Value of the policy. It can be accessed partially or in full via withdrawals, loans or a full surrender of the policy. The intended purpose of cash values was to create a comprehensive financial product with both an insurance and savings component , reducing the need to get each individually. It also offered a structured approach to saving as premiums must be paid routinely, forcing the insured to save. Endowment \u00b6 Endowment Insurance offers coverage for a fixed period but also has a cash value component. It is intended to be a saving oriented product with limited insurance coverage. The intended goal is for the policy to mature and payout the maturity benefit, which can be used to fund specific financial goals at known points in time such as funding education expenses or purchasing a home. In Singapore, they typically come in one of two variations: Type Short Term Long Term Benefit Structure Non Participating Participating Selling Point Capital Guaranteed Prospect of high returns By Benefit Structure \u00b6 Non-Participating \u00b6 A Non-Participating Policy is one that only has guaranteed benefits . Non participating term policies are entirely protection based , ideal for policyholders who do not wish to mix protection with savings/investments. Participating \u00b6 A Participating Policy is one that participates in profit sharing with the insurer. As such, they are also commonly referred to as a \"With-Profits\" policy. The premiums from all participating policies are pooled together into a Participating Fund managed by the insurer. The fund is used to support the operations of the policies (expenses and benefits), where the remaining balance is invested with the goal of generating stable long-term returns . Every year, the health of the participating fund is measured based on its ability to support future benefit payments and profit sharing. The excess can be understood as the \"Profit\" of the participating fund, which is shared with policyholders in the form of a Bonus . Bonuses are often referred to as Non-Guaranteed benefits as the performance of the participating fund is not guaranteed. The key selling point of a participating policy is that there are limited downside risks : Guaranteed benefits will be received regardless of the performance of the par fund Declared bonuses are guaranteed and will be received regardless of the future performance of the par fund Bonus declaration can only be positive; losses are NOT shared Universal Life \u00b6 A Universal Life policy is one that offers flexibility to the policyholder, allowing them to effectively design their policy. The wide range of options available to the policyholder is why it is called \"Universal\". Each policy has a cash account built into it: Premiums are paid into the account Insurance and expense charges are deducted Interest is credited to the account based on the rate earned by the insurer Note There is typically a minimum guaranteed rate that the insurer will credit regardless of the performance of their investments to ensure that the cash account will grow. The following options can be changed by the policyholder: Premiums : Size and frequency of premiums Sum Assured : Size can be changed (subject to underwriting) Interest : Credited rate can be tagged to another source (Index or Mutual Funds) The cash value of the policy can be accessed via a withdrawal or loan. However, if the cash account reduces to zero (due to insufficient premiums or interest) then the policy will lapse . The key selling point of a UL policy is its flexibility to meet a wide variety of needs. Unit Linked \u00b6 A Unit-Linked Policy is one that invests the premiums into unit trusts of professionally managed mutual funds of the policyholder's choice. This is why they are also commonly referred to as an Investment-Linked Policies (ILP). Each policy has a unit account that stores the purchased units. The account value is the total NAV of the units at the time. The unit account is conceptually similar to the cash account of a UL policy: Premiums are used to purchase units of chosen funds Units are sold to pay off any insurance or expense charges The account value can be accessed via a withdrawal or loan, through the sale of the units at the prevailing NAV. Similarly, if the account value reduces to zero due to poor market conditions, the policy will lapse . There are generally two types of ILPs, which determines how the death benefit is structured: Protection Focused Investment Focused Has sum assured Does NOT have sum assured Higher of account value and sum assured Higher of account value and total premiums paid The key selling point of an ILP is that it is able to generate high returns , allowing it to overcome inflation which has typically plagued the other types of insurance policies. Unlike all other forms of insurance, there are NO investment guarantees . The policyholder bears ALL the investment risk . If the underlying funds perform badly, the account value could decrease and result in a loss for the policyholder. Consumer Considerations \u00b6 Buy term & invest the rest \u00b6 The key idea is that you do not need to have coverage for your entire life \u2013 At some point, your dependents will grow up and become financially independent. They do not need the extra windfall from life insurance Another reason is that the payoffs from Par Products or ILPs are generally poor \u2013 if you invested the additional money you paid for those products vs Term Insurance in a market index fund, you would get much better results A decent amount of the premiums in the first few years goes towards commission for the intermediaries \u2013 which means that the compounding effect kicks in much later However, for people who can\u2019t be bothered to learn simple investing or do not have the discipline to invest, insurance investments may not be a bad choice The Argument for Whole Life \u00b6 Although our dependents may become financially independent, most would like to leave a something behind for their children once they are gone, thus they would like to be covered till the very end Another key reason is that the policyholder only needs to go through Medical Underwriting ONCE. If your health worsens later on in life, it will not negatively affect premiums, and everything will still be covered. Thus, it is good to buy whole life insurance while you are young & healthy This is in contrast to a case whereby you purchase cheap term insurance for X years, but after X years your health deteriorates, and you would like to renew but it suddenly becomes very expensive","title":"**Life Products**"},{"location":"Archive/3_Life_Insurance/1_Life_Products/#life-products","text":"This section is meant to provide an overview of the key features of the different types of life insurance policies and their common variations.","title":"Life Products"},{"location":"Archive/3_Life_Insurance/1_Life_Products/#product-type","text":"There are several types of insurance that fall under the \"Life\" category.

Thus, TPD insurance similarly provides Income replacement and Debt Repayment coverage for the beneficiaries of the insured. They also incur additional expenses that can be covered with the benefit pay out: Medical Expenses : Healthcare costs not covered by Health Insurance (Due to nature of treatment or coverage limit) Non-Medical Expenses : Cost of home modifications or assistive devices to aid living with TPD (EG. Wheelchair ramps or Communication aids) Since the benefit can be used to cover necessary expenses, it ensures that no financial burden falls upon the family of the insured.

Some policies also have a Deferred Period as well \u2013 a minimum amount of time that you must have been afflicted with the health condition before any claim can be made Insureds are allowed to split their investments into multiple different funds , allowing them to diversify their exposure.

On top of the typical insurance related charges, they also contain investment related charges (Fund Management Charges, Expense Ratios etc). Regardless of the investment performance, the insurer will take a fixed spread from the investment. Note that it is often difficult to determine the actual price of the units used for allocations or charges as there is often a delay due to processing. The transaction may only occur a few days later, thus using the unit price then rather than when it was initiated. The death benefit of the policy is the typically the higher of the Account Value or a Capital Guarantee , similar to Endowment Insurance. The NAAR of the policy is the Capital Guarantee less the Account Value. Thus, if the account value is sufficiently high, the NAAR will be negative and there will be no mortality charges on the policy. The surrender benefit of the policy is only the account value. \\[ \\displaylines{ Death~Benefit = Max (Account~Value, Capital~Guarantee) \\\\ NAAR = Capital~Guarantee - Account~Value } \\] Annuity \u00b6 How do Annuities work? \u00b6 Policyholders must first decide when they would like to start receiving for payments and for how long . The date they start receiving payments is known as the Maturity Date while the period between the point of purchase till maturity is the Accumulation Period . Policyholders will pay premiums during the accumulation period, where they will then be invested in a fund. The value of the fund on the maturity date is known as the Accumulation Value . Based on the accumulation value, the policy will then determine how much to pay out per month such that the fund value will be fully exhausted during the payment period. Thus, annuities are generally known as Savings products as policyholders will contribute to the Annuity fund periodically to receive later withdraw from it. They are typically (but not exclusively) used for retirement in the form of a pension where policyholders will make regular contributions to the fund while working and receive monthly payouts starting from retirement. Endowment Insurance \u00b6 Endowment Insurance is a Savings Oriented permanent insurance policy but with a limited policy period , similar to term insurance. As its name suggests, the primary goal of Endowment Insurance is for the policy to Endow and provide a payout to the insured, which is why the policy period is limited. They are typically participating policies. To compete with other similar savings products (Fixed Deposit etc), the amount paid into the policy must be at least the amount paid out, providing a Capital Guarantee . Thus, the SA of the policy is the Savings Goal chosen by the insured and is usually equal to the sum of all premiums paid over the life of the policy . The savings goal is the amount the insured wishes to save . Thus, the premiums paid over the life of the policy must be equal to this amount, akin to saving in a bank account to meet a target. Unlike other policies, the death benefit is NOT equal to the SA. The death benefit is usually some function (~105%) of the total premiums paid up till that point , providing a capital guarantee as well. The maturity benefit of the policy is usually the sum of the SA and participating dividends . The \"interest\" earned on the product is largely dependent on the performance of the participating fund. Agents receive higher commissions for selling universal and other whole life policies than they do for selling less expensive term life insurance, leading to concerns about conflicts of interest.[6] Proponents respond that it would be inaccurate to state that term insurance is less expensive than universal life, or for that matter, other forms of permanent life insurance, without qualifying the statement with the other factor: Time, or length of coverage. While term life insurance is the least expensive over a short period, say one to twenty years, permanent life insurance is generally the least expensive over a longer period, or over one's entire lifetime. This is mainly due to the high percentage of the premiums paid out in commissions during the first 10\u201312 years A well informed policyholder should understand that the flexibility of the policy is tied irrevocably to risk to the policyholder. The more guarantees a policy has, the more expensive its cost. Potentially higher costs - VUL policies may be more expensive than other types of permanent insurance, such as Whole Life and traditional Universal Life. Volatility of cash surrender values, especially at late duration, can cause a \"reverse dollar cost averaging\" effect that results in higher costs of insurance charges. Proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk, but it cannot be completely eliminated. Insurers Prefer Unit-Linked Policies Commissions for these unit linked policies are the highest \u2013 which incentivizes intermediaries to focus on them more compared to traditional products These commissions are intentionally set by the company \u2013 this means that insurers are trying to sell more unit-linked products This is possibly due to the lower risk borne by the insurer (No guaranteed benefits) which would subsequently reduce the regulatory requirements on the insurer However, another view is that the product is much more complex and is harder to explain to clients which warrants a higher commission on the intermediary\u2019s end Excessive charges COnsidered investment securities and must be given a proespectus Must be sold by registered individuals who pass a financial exam This makes a VL policy potentially more attractive than every other kind of policy. However, this is only true if the return on investments outpace both inflation and the investment return of the insurer. Although equity does earn substantially higher returns over a long period of time, short term deviations are inevitable and the policy value could drop substantially if the investments go bad. lock your money up in all kinds of strange ways and do not compensate you for the illiquidity. Interesting Insights from Annuities No Underwriting Needed \u2022 Typically, no underwriting is needed for Annuity products \u2022 This is because the insurer prefers if you die earlier \u2192 Less annuity payments needed \u2022 Thus, they do not bother to check for your health \u2192 Encourages people of poor health to purchase them as well Annuities as Pure Endowments \u2022 A pure endowment (different from regular endowment insurance) is one that pays out a maturity benefit \u2022 Purchasing an Annuity is akin to purchasing multiple pure endowments of different terms up to the policy term of the annuity Male-Female Mortality Differences \u2022 In general, Males have higher Mortality than Females o Males tend to live shorter lives; Females tend to live longer lives \u2022 All else equals, this means that: o Males have a higher Mortality Risk and pay more insurance premiums o Males have lower Longevity Risk and pay lower annuity premiums \u2022 Highlights the difference between Insurance and Annuity style products typically children depending on their parents before the become independent. Whole life insurance can provide a foundation to allow the household to spend more and still be able to provide a bequest, or to increase spending even further by using the cash value as a volatility buffer for the investment portfolio Since these risks are related to the life of the policyholder, the only way for an insurer to properly assess their risks are through a medical examination & questionnaires, known as medical underwriting Anticipated Endowment - Similar to a bond annuity is chaging longevity for credit risk because the insurer must be solvent throughout that period to receive the payments Even if the insured does not pay the required premiums on the payment date, the insurer usually offers a Grace Period (~1 Month) from that date where they will accept the required payment with no other penalty or requirement . If the insured still does not pay the premiums by the end of the grace period, then the policy will Lapse - it is no longer in effect and the insurer will not respond to any claims made. Medical Underwriting \u00b6 Second Hand Policies \u00b6 Endowment selling Buy for more than the surrender value The new owner takes on responsibility for future premium payments and collects the maturity value when the policy matures or the death benefit when the original life assured dies. Policyholders who sell their policies no longer benefit from the life cover and should consider whether to take out alternative cover. Investors will pay more than the surrender value because the policy has greater value if it is kept in force than if it is terminated early.","title":"**Product Features**"},{"location":"Archive/3_Life_Insurance/2_Product_Features/#product-features","text":"This section is meant to dive deeper into commonly found product features within each major product category.","title":"Product Features"},{"location":"Archive/3_Life_Insurance/2_Product_Features/#term","text":"\u2022 They typically also have a Waiting Period \u2013 A fixed amount of time from the purchase of the policy to when benefits will be paid out.

As its name suggests, the primary goal of Endowment Insurance is for the policy to Endow and provide a payout to the insured, which is why the policy period is limited. They are typically participating policies. To compete with other similar savings products (Fixed Deposit etc), the amount paid into the policy must be at least the amount paid out, providing a Capital Guarantee . Thus, the SA of the policy is the Savings Goal chosen by the insured and is usually equal to the sum of all premiums paid over the life of the policy . The savings goal is the amount the insured wishes to save . Thus, the premiums paid over the life of the policy must be equal to this amount, akin to saving in a bank account to meet a target. Unlike other policies, the death benefit is NOT equal to the SA. The death benefit is usually some function (~105%) of the total premiums paid up till that point , providing a capital guarantee as well. The maturity benefit of the policy is usually the sum of the SA and participating dividends . The \"interest\" earned on the product is largely dependent on the performance of the participating fund. Agents receive higher commissions for selling universal and other whole life policies than they do for selling less expensive term life insurance, leading to concerns about conflicts of interest.[6] Proponents respond that it would be inaccurate to state that term insurance is less expensive than universal life, or for that matter, other forms of permanent life insurance, without qualifying the statement with the other factor: Time, or length of coverage. While term life insurance is the least expensive over a short period, say one to twenty years, permanent life insurance is generally the least expensive over a longer period, or over one's entire lifetime. This is mainly due to the high percentage of the premiums paid out in commissions during the first 10\u201312 years A well informed policyholder should understand that the flexibility of the policy is tied irrevocably to risk to the policyholder. The more guarantees a policy has, the more expensive its cost. Potentially higher costs - VUL policies may be more expensive than other types of permanent insurance, such as Whole Life and traditional Universal Life. Volatility of cash surrender values, especially at late duration, can cause a \"reverse dollar cost averaging\" effect that results in higher costs of insurance charges. Proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk, but it cannot be completely eliminated. Insurers Prefer Unit-Linked Policies Commissions for these unit linked policies are the highest \u2013 which incentivizes intermediaries to focus on them more compared to traditional products These commissions are intentionally set by the company \u2013 this means that insurers are trying to sell more unit-linked products This is possibly due to the lower risk borne by the insurer (No guaranteed benefits) which would subsequently reduce the regulatory requirements on the insurer However, another view is that the product is much more complex and is harder to explain to clients which warrants a higher commission on the intermediary\u2019s end Excessive charges COnsidered investment securities and must be given a proespectus Must be sold by registered individuals who pass a financial exam This makes a VL policy potentially more attractive than every other kind of policy. However, this is only true if the return on investments outpace both inflation and the investment return of the insurer. Although equity does earn substantially higher returns over a long period of time, short term deviations are inevitable and the policy value could drop substantially if the investments go bad. lock your money up in all kinds of strange ways and do not compensate you for the illiquidity.

Finance valuation typically focuses on valuing assets in order to determine an approriate stock price while Actuarial valuation focuses on valuing liabilities to determine the required reserve for the policy. Unlike finance, valuation in insurance is a heavily regulated process with a fixed method of doing so. It is typically done by considering the difference in the present value of the expected cash inflows and outflows (NPV) from the insurer's perpective . Cash Inflows Cash Outflows Premium Insurance benefits & Expenses 1. Singapore Regulation \u00b6 Valuation in Singapore is governed by the Insurance (Valuation and Capital) Regulations 2004 which is part of a larger set of regulations known as the Insurance Act . The methodology for valuation is described in sections 20 and 20A of the 2004 regulation for valuation on a Net (after reinsurance) and Gross (before reinsurance) basis respectively. 1.1 Prescribed Methodology \u00b6 For non-participating policies, Policy Liability = Expected Future Payments (Benefits & Expenses) - Expected Future Receipts + Provision for Adverse Deviation For participating policies, Policy Liability = Expected Future Payments - Expected Future Receipts + Provision for Adverse Deviation + Future Allocations of Bonus/Surplus For unit-linked policies, Policy Liability = Unit Reserves + Non-unit Reserves where Unit Reserves = Value of underlying assets Non Unit Reserve = Expected Future Payments - Expected Future Receipts + Provision for Adverse Deviation Notice that all methods are at least the sum of the Net Expected Payments and Provision for Adverse Deviation . 1.2 Present Value \u00b6 All values in the previous section are the Present Values of the respective cashflows, calculated using the Discounted Cashflow Method . For non-participating and unit-linked policies, the discount rate to use is the Risk Free Rate (RFR), which can be obtained from the government yield curves. RFR is used to discount as these cashflows are guaranteed and thus Risk Free . For participating policies, the discount rate to use is the Best Estimate Investment Return (BEIR), which is calculated by the insurer based on what they expect the assets backing the policy to earn. Since it has non-guaranteed benefits depending on the performance of its underlying assets , we should use return of the underlying assets for discounting. The timing of the cashflows also matters when it comes to discounting. If we assume cashflows occur at the start of the period, they will be discounted slightly less than those that occur at the end. In general, premium , commissions and expenses occur at the start of the period as these cashflows must occur for the policy to remain in force for the remaining of the period. Similarly, maturity cashflows occur at the start as the policy is in force till the end of the policy period (inclusive). All other cashflows are typically assumed to be at the end of the period. 1.3 Expected Value \u00b6 All cashflows in a typical life insurance policy are contingent on the policyholder lapsing, dying or neither during the policy term. As such, we should not consider the absolute value of these cashflows but rather the Expected Values at each period. This is done by multiplying the cashflow by a probability of (not) Lapsing ( Lapse Rate ) and/or Dying ( Mortality Rate ). Additionally, there are some values that we do not know for sure of at the time of valuation such as Expenses or Bonuses as they are dependent on the economic environment at the time. For these cashflows, we make assumptions about how they would by assuming they would be grow based on a certain rate . Thus, the Present Value of the Net Expected Payments is also referred to as the Best Estimate Liability (BEL). This is because the assumptions we use should be our best guess about how the future will play out, which is based on our recent experience of the policyholders. 1.3a Valuation Assumptions \u00b6 Regulators don't generally like negative reserves, as including credit for them reduces the overall reserve amount (so the insurance company has less backing assets) and it is imprudent, as the policyholder in the situation above may realise their position and lapse their policy (so the insurance company never actually receives the positive premiums). Each country has their own set of regulations regarding how reserves should be calculated and how much capital should be held o Insurance (Valuation and Capital) Regulations 2004 o Notice 133 Valuation and Capital Framework for Insurers \u2022 A fully qualified actuary must sign off on the reserves to attest that the reserves have been properly determined in adherence to the relevant guidelines o Remember that the goal is NOT to prevent insurance companies from going insolvent but rather to protect policyholders from the consequences of insolvency 1.4 Provision for Adverse Deviation \u00b6 Calculating liabilities based on BEL alone assumes that our assumptions are 100% correct, which is almost never in practice. If our actual experience is worse than our assumptions, then the reserve for that period will NOT be enough to cover claims in that period, leading to bankruptcy. In order to avoid that scenario, insurers are required to hold some additional capital as a buffer, formally known as Risk Margin or Provision for Adverse Deviation . BEL + PAD is calculated by shocking each of the assumptions used by a PAD factor. Note that the shock applied must result in a worse situation for the insurer (higher reserve). This means that the shock could be an increase or decrease (not strict) as certain assumptions have an ambiguous effect on reserves. For instance, increasing Lapse rates increase both Surrender/Death Benefit (Outflows) & Premiums (Inflows). Thus, there is a need to test which direction to apply the shock. 1.5 Minimum Condition Liability \u00b6 The BEL for participating policies captures both the Guaranteed and Non-Guaranteed benefits. This may not be an \"accurate\" representaton of the liability as the non-guaranteed benefits may not occur at all. Thus, we instead consider ONLY the guaranteed benefits of a participating policy - which forms the lower bound (minimum) of the liability. Similar to before, since only guaranteed benefits are considered, we should use the RFR for discounting. This is also commonly referred to as the Minimum Condition Liability (MCL) of a participating policy. Note that there is no such thing as MCL for a non-participating products as they only have guaranteed benefits - there is no minimum. 2. Modelling \u00b6 Given the large number of policyholders, it is not feasible to manually calculate the liability. Thus, actuarial models are built to automatically calculate the values for us. There are many different types of Life Insurance products, each with their own distinct features. Thus, each type of product needs to have its own model. Similarly, each product has many different policyholders, each with their own unique information - Sex , Age , Premium , Sum Assured etc. These are usually called Model Point data as they are used as inputs into the model. For a single model point, Excel can be easily used to calculate the liability for checking purposes. However, Excel is not suited to repeat calculations for multiple model points (although possible). Most major insurers would use enterprise level software to calculate the liability, such as FIS Prophet or Moody's AXIS . These software have the capability to calculate the liability for multiple model points and multiple products at once. In general, these software accomplish this by considering three sets of inputs: Global Inputs - Assumptions that are constant across ALL models (EG. Discount Rate) Parameter Inputs - Assumtions that are unique to each model (EG. Lapse Rates) Model Point Inputs - Policyholder information 2.1 Modelling VS Valuation \u00b6 Some companies make a clear distinction between the two - Modelling is focused on building and mainting the models, while Valuation is concerned about preparing inputs and intepreting output. Regardless of a split or not, the two functions are heavily intertwined with one another - it is important to know both sides of the process.

Regardless of a split or not, the two functions are heavily intertwined with one another - it is important to know both sides of the process. This is not very easy question to answer, and I'm not great at explaining things but I'll try my best. The two questions tie hand in hand. You are mixing up the \"reserve\" with the \"liability\". The reserve is the present value of future liability minus the present value of assets. For simplicity's sake, I will ignore expenses and profits, so the liability is just the claim payments (outgo) and assets are premium payments (inflow). Another perhaps obvious thing is, a larger (more positive) reserve is \"bad\" for the insurer in the sense that they have to find ways to get more money to pay this off. I tend to think of the reserve = 0 at t = 0 as a pricing philosophy, where you should charge the premium such that it equals the liability, net of expenses and profits. And the 0 reserve at time 0 is a trivial product of this philosophy. For the U-shaped reserve, imagine you are an insurer and you sold a whole life policy to an 18-year-old, and the premium is $P per year until they die, and the policy pays $F when they die. EDIT: I'm wrong. I was wrong because in my example, the good years in the beginning must suggest all the years after that will be equally as bad. (eg. if I gained $50 in first 2 years, then in the rest of the policy life time, I am expected to lose $50 so that at time 0 I break even, ignoring interest). here's the (what I think) correct explanation: Now imagine you sold many policies of the same kind. The early years' future claim payments doesn't decrease a lot, since the policyholder is healthy (claim payments are back-loaded), but the future premiums decrease more or less linearly. This means that the PV(liability)-PV(premiums) will increase in early years. And decrease in later years because the policies's liability decrease per year gets larger and larger. This is perhaps an overly simplistic answer but I hope I got the idea across. For the second part, the reserve pattern with policy duration is hump shaped because the expected present value of the remaining future benefits decrease slowly at early durations ( as the overall probability of claiming under the policy only reduces by a relatively small amount), but increasingly rapidly at later durations ( as the probability of a claim being made under the policy decrease quickly to zero as the end of the term approaches). In contrast, the expected present value of the future premiums declines at an almost linear rate ( assuming level premiums) with increasing policy duration. The reserve = 0 at time 0 is the result in net premium valuation because the net premium is set at the level where PV NP = PV Benefits. Under the real life situation (esp. low interest rate environment), it is possible to have NP capped by the gross premium, and the insurer needs to set up premium deficiency reserve at policy inception. reserve is pv death Ben less pv prem. If pv death Ben is higher than pv prem at the start of the policy, it would be unprofitable. The company can pay for the death benefit that happens in year one, because they sell a hundred policies and take in a hundred premiums in year one, but only one person dies, so they redirect premiums from multiple policies to pay for the one claim in year one. term life has level premiums, but increasing mortality costs. In early years, the excess premium goes to building a reserve. In later years, the reserve is used to pay for death benefits being higher than premiums. This explanation is a bit theoretical, but is fundamentally how it works. This ignores expenses, profits, etc, which add a bit of complexity. Life Insurance & Annuities for Actuaries Life Contingencies Overview As mentioned earlier, Life Insurance is extremely long term \u2013 Actuaries in this field mainly deal with cashflow projections Each policy has a different feature which results in different Per-Policy Cashflows These cashflows are contingent on a certain event happening (Surviving, Death or Lapse). Thus, it is not appropriate to consider the raw cashflows but rather the In-Force (Expected) Cashflows using the Number of Policyholders (NOP) Additionally, these cashflows occur far into the future. Instead of considering their raw values, we consider their present value to properly account for the time value of money Number of Policyholders (NOP) Consider a population of 1000 similar policyholders. We know the following information: Number of Policyholders alive at the start of the period Number of Policyholders who Lapsed during period Number of Policyholders who Died during period Number of Policyholders who Matured during period Number of Policyholders alive at the End of the Period With this information, we can simply multiply the respective cashflows by the number of policyholders that triggered that cashflow: Premium*NOP Alive at period start Death Benefit*NOP Died during period Surrender Benefit *NOP Lapsed during period Maturity Benefit*NOP Mature during period Assuming that the Cashflows for all the policyholders are the same In practice, we typically build models to project one policyholder at a time. Thus, we consider a starting population of 1 This means that subsequent NOP cannot be greater than 1 or smaller than 0 \u2013 like a probability rate. Thus, in-force cashflows are like Expected Cashflows However, we will not know the actual NOP till the period has passed. Thus, we will need to project these NOP by analysing our experience & using Survival Models Experience Studies We need to make several assumptions about the future to make our results more concrete. We typically make assumptions on: Decrements \u2192 Rates that remove the policyholder from the population (Death, Lapse, Maturity) Utilization \u2192 Rates that DO NOT remove the policyholder from the population (Partial Withdrawal, Premium Holiday etc) Other Global Variables \u2192 Interest rates, Expense etc Insurers typically analyse their past data through Experience Studies to obtain assumptions that best reflects their experience to predict the future. The results of these studies represent snapshots in time \u2013 thus periodic reviews must be conducted to fully make use of new experience All of these assumptions pose a risk to the insurer. If our actual experience is worse than what we assumed, then our calculations are insufficient to cover costs etc On the flipside, if our actual experience is better than assumed, this means that our calculations were excessive thus the excess reserves are released as profits Anything can be done in Life Insurance, if we expect it Sales Channel increase lapse Direct channle higher risk because they know their risk better and willingly join the pool Agent lower risk because they go to client High interest rates are great for the industry because most of the industry is in Bonds Investment incoming should be booming if held to maturity Potential issue is disintermediation - if interest rates rise, then products that are crediting low rates will be unexpectedly lapsed (from the company's perspective) lapsed as consumers just go to buy directly from the market with booming rates Companies will need to liquidate their holdings to pay off these lapsers However, since market value of these assets falls, then this will lead to a loss for them Insurance uses ALM so PV of liability and PV of bonds fall together, no impact on existing business New business will be repriced to reflect new environment Insurers focus on asset liability matching rather than pure price When interest rates increase, both the PV of liability and bond price decreases together, thus they offset each other PA Policy Asset PL Policy Liability PPT is premium payment term Cant keep changing assumptions also Experience, adjust credibility plus loading Inflation tough because they represent rising cost but there may be regulations which makes it hard to pass down this cost to consumers Insurance companies take up good debt to reduce the risk charge - no need to hold extra investments and can reduce expenditure, protecting bottom line Survival Models Choose a Valuation date \u2013 Any date after policy inception and before policy maturity Our implicit assumption is that the policyholder is alive at the date \u2013 Thus the NOP on the valuation date is always 1 Using our assumptions about Mortality & Lapse, we can model the NOP: We need to calculate how many people Die or Lapse each period We do this by multiplying the NOP at period start with the probability of Dying or Lapsing WITHIN THAT PERIOD respectively NOP_End=NOP_Start-NOP_Surrender-NOP_Death-NOP_Maturity Naturally, the NOP for a period end is the NOP for the next period start The tricky part is determining the probability of Dying or Lapsing: We usually assume a certain percentage of people Die or Lapse each year However, valuation is typically done in monthly time periods We thus need to adjust the given rates: Both Lapse and Mortality are decrements \u2013 in other words they are discount rates, not interest rates We can convert them using \u2192 (1-Monthly)=(1-Yearly)^(1/12) There is a more theoretically correct method to do this using survival rates, but the result is identical The NOP Death and Lapse dictate the total number of people who die or lapse in a period assuming all else constant. When assuming both together, it becomes complicated: If you already died, then you cannot lapse, vice versa. This means that the NOP of Death and Lapse should be much lower than they are There are theoretical ways to overcome this, but in practice we usually assume that people die first or lapse first, which affects your NOP calculation Policies mature at the start of the period, so the NOP Maturity is simply the starting NOP of the first period after the policy term (IE NOP of last the period in policy term) Mortality Tables Each mortality table typically has two forms \u2013 Select & Ultimate Mortality The Select table is used for new business while Ultimate is used for existing business Select Mortality is LOWER than Ultimate Mortality \u2192 Less likely to die This is because new business has gone through medical underwriting and should be healthier, thus should have lower mortality (All else equal) Once the policy has been in-force for 1-2 years, the policy will then use the Ultimate Mortality table which has a higher mortality (All else equal) Interesting Impact of Decrements Consider a base case of decrements and cashflows If we increase decrements in the early years, then naturally the expected outflow cashflows in the early years will increase as well However, because more policyholders left the pool early on, there will be fewer to leave the pool in the future, causing a decrease in expected outflows in the future Conversely, assuming lower decrements early on will lower expected outflows in the early years while increasing expected outflows in the future Life Pricing \u2013 Goal is to cover the expected losses and achieve some level of profit Main factors to price based on: Gender Age Smoking Status Underwriting Loading Factors like Health Conditions, Foreigners, Occupation etc Life Insurance uses VNB, EV NBS etc Reserve = Claims \u2013 Prem Negative is good, means we are collecting more premium than claims Reserve only affects tge timing of profit Under RBC2, C1 risk charge is 95%VAR (~2SD) Sweet Spot is to hold 90% (~1SD) as PAD Don\u2019t hold too much as PAD because opportunity cost of capital Don\u2019t hold too little because regulator will challenge If set C1 = PAad, its an accounting trick to artificially increase the CAR of the company C1 and Pad are complement of each other EV = Value of In Force \u2013 Adjusted Net Worth Value in force = Future Profits Adjusted Net Worth ARE THE NON VALUABLE items History of EV > Hostile takeovers in the 1900s People unsure how to properly measure profitability Come up with EV as a way to measure the profitability Metric to shareholder since the share price is often not a reliable measure IFRS17 too aligned with the banks and Australian profit thingy GWP > Volume EV > Profitability NBEV > New business NBEV_TU > Minus top up from ILP holders Grwoth oriented metric No point to build a new prophet system Existing systems already use prophet, people know how to use prophet Very hard to break into the market Regulations in insurance exist because an information asymmetry exists between the seller and buyer of insurance products.

Regardless of a split or not, the two functions are heavily intertwined with one another - it is important to know both sides of the process. This is not very easy question to answer, and I'm not great at explaining things but I'll try my best. The two questions tie hand in hand. You are mixing up the \"reserve\" with the \"liability\". The reserve is the present value of future liability minus the present value of assets. For simplicity's sake, I will ignore expenses and profits, so the liability is just the claim payments (outgo) and assets are premium payments (inflow). Another perhaps obvious thing is, a larger (more positive) reserve is \"bad\" for the insurer in the sense that they have to find ways to get more money to pay this off. I tend to think of the reserve = 0 at t = 0 as a pricing philosophy, where you should charge the premium such that it equals the liability, net of expenses and profits. And the 0 reserve at time 0 is a trivial product of this philosophy. For the U-shaped reserve, imagine you are an insurer and you sold a whole life policy to an 18-year-old, and the premium is $P per year until they die, and the policy pays $F when they die. EDIT: I'm wrong. I was wrong because in my example, the good years in the beginning must suggest all the years after that will be equally as bad. (eg. if I gained $50 in first 2 years, then in the rest of the policy life time, I am expected to lose $50 so that at time 0 I break even, ignoring interest). here's the (what I think) correct explanation: Now imagine you sold many policies of the same kind. The early years' future claim payments doesn't decrease a lot, since the policyholder is healthy (claim payments are back-loaded), but the future premiums decrease more or less linearly. This means that the PV(liability)-PV(premiums) will increase in early years. And decrease in later years because the policies's liability decrease per year gets larger and larger. This is perhaps an overly simplistic answer but I hope I got the idea across. For the second part, the reserve pattern with policy duration is hump shaped because the expected present value of the remaining future benefits decrease slowly at early durations ( as the overall probability of claiming under the policy only reduces by a relatively small amount), but increasingly rapidly at later durations ( as the probability of a claim being made under the policy decrease quickly to zero as the end of the term approaches). In contrast, the expected present value of the future premiums declines at an almost linear rate ( assuming level premiums) with increasing policy duration. The reserve = 0 at time 0 is the result in net premium valuation because the net premium is set at the level where PV NP = PV Benefits. Under the real life situation (esp. low interest rate environment), it is possible to have NP capped by the gross premium, and the insurer needs to set up premium deficiency reserve at policy inception. reserve is pv death Ben less pv prem. If pv death Ben is higher than pv prem at the start of the policy, it would be unprofitable. The company can pay for the death benefit that happens in year one, because they sell a hundred policies and take in a hundred premiums in year one, but only one person dies, so they redirect premiums from multiple policies to pay for the one claim in year one. term life has level premiums, but increasing mortality costs. In early years, the excess premium goes to building a reserve. In later years, the reserve is used to pay for death benefits being higher than premiums. This explanation is a bit theoretical, but is fundamentally how it works. This ignores expenses, profits, etc, which add a bit of complexity. Life Insurance & Annuities for Actuaries Life Contingencies Overview As mentioned earlier, Life Insurance is extremely long term \u2013 Actuaries in this field mainly deal with cashflow projections Each policy has a different feature which results in different Per-Policy Cashflows These cashflows are contingent on a certain event happening (Surviving, Death or Lapse). Thus, it is not appropriate to consider the raw cashflows but rather the In-Force (Expected) Cashflows using the Number of Policyholders (NOP) Additionally, these cashflows occur far into the future. Instead of considering their raw values, we consider their present value to properly account for the time value of money Number of Policyholders (NOP) Consider a population of 1000 similar policyholders. We know the following information: Number of Policyholders alive at the start of the period Number of Policyholders who Lapsed during period Number of Policyholders who Died during period Number of Policyholders who Matured during period Number of Policyholders alive at the End of the Period With this information, we can simply multiply the respective cashflows by the number of policyholders that triggered that cashflow: Premium*NOP Alive at period start Death Benefit*NOP Died during period Surrender Benefit *NOP Lapsed during period Maturity Benefit*NOP Mature during period Assuming that the Cashflows for all the policyholders are the same In practice, we typically build models to project one policyholder at a time. Thus, we consider a starting population of 1 This means that subsequent NOP cannot be greater than 1 or smaller than 0 \u2013 like a probability rate. Thus, in-force cashflows are like Expected Cashflows However, we will not know the actual NOP till the period has passed. Thus, we will need to project these NOP by analysing our experience & using Survival Models Experience Studies We need to make several assumptions about the future to make our results more concrete. We typically make assumptions on: Decrements \u2192 Rates that remove the policyholder from the population (Death, Lapse, Maturity) Utilization \u2192 Rates that DO NOT remove the policyholder from the population (Partial Withdrawal, Premium Holiday etc) Other Global Variables \u2192 Interest rates, Expense etc Insurers typically analyse their past data through Experience Studies to obtain assumptions that best reflects their experience to predict the future. The results of these studies represent snapshots in time \u2013 thus periodic reviews must be conducted to fully make use of new experience All of these assumptions pose a risk to the insurer. If our actual experience is worse than what we assumed, then our calculations are insufficient to cover costs etc On the flipside, if our actual experience is better than assumed, this means that our calculations were excessive thus the excess reserves are released as profits Anything can be done in Life Insurance, if we expect it Sales Channel increase lapse Direct channle higher risk because they know their risk better and willingly join the pool Agent lower risk because they go to client High interest rates are great for the industry because most of the industry is in Bonds Investment incoming should be booming if held to maturity Potential issue is disintermediation - if interest rates rise, then products that are crediting low rates will be unexpectedly lapsed (from the company's perspective) lapsed as consumers just go to buy directly from the market with booming rates Companies will need to liquidate their holdings to pay off these lapsers However, since market value of these assets falls, then this will lead to a loss for them Insurance uses ALM so PV of liability and PV of bonds fall together, no impact on existing business New business will be repriced to reflect new environment Insurers focus on asset liability matching rather than pure price When interest rates increase, both the PV of liability and bond price decreases together, thus they offset each other PA Policy Asset PL Policy Liability PPT is premium payment term Cant keep changing assumptions also Experience, adjust credibility plus loading Inflation tough because they represent rising cost but there may be regulations which makes it hard to pass down this cost to consumers Insurance companies take up good debt to reduce the risk charge - no need to hold extra investments and can reduce expenditure, protecting bottom line Survival Models Choose a Valuation date \u2013 Any date after policy inception and before policy maturity Our implicit assumption is that the policyholder is alive at the date \u2013 Thus the NOP on the valuation date is always 1 Using our assumptions about Mortality & Lapse, we can model the NOP: We need to calculate how many people Die or Lapse each period We do this by multiplying the NOP at period start with the probability of Dying or Lapsing WITHIN THAT PERIOD respectively NOP_End=NOP_Start-NOP_Surrender-NOP_Death-NOP_Maturity Naturally, the NOP for a period end is the NOP for the next period start The tricky part is determining the probability of Dying or Lapsing: We usually assume a certain percentage of people Die or Lapse each year However, valuation is typically done in monthly time periods We thus need to adjust the given rates: Both Lapse and Mortality are decrements \u2013 in other words they are discount rates, not interest rates We can convert them using \u2192 (1-Monthly)=(1-Yearly)^(1/12) There is a more theoretically correct method to do this using survival rates, but the result is identical The NOP Death and Lapse dictate the total number of people who die or lapse in a period assuming all else constant. When assuming both together, it becomes complicated: If you already died, then you cannot lapse, vice versa. This means that the NOP of Death and Lapse should be much lower than they are There are theoretical ways to overcome this, but in practice we usually assume that people die first or lapse first, which affects your NOP calculation Policies mature at the start of the period, so the NOP Maturity is simply the starting NOP of the first period after the policy term (IE NOP of last the period in policy term) Mortality Tables Each mortality table typically has two forms \u2013 Select & Ultimate Mortality The Select table is used for new business while Ultimate is used for existing business Select Mortality is LOWER than Ultimate Mortality \u2192 Less likely to die This is because new business has gone through medical underwriting and should be healthier, thus should have lower mortality (All else equal) Once the policy has been in-force for 1-2 years, the policy will then use the Ultimate Mortality table which has a higher mortality (All else equal) Interesting Impact of Decrements Consider a base case of decrements and cashflows If we increase decrements in the early years, then naturally the expected outflow cashflows in the early years will increase as well However, because more policyholders left the pool early on, there will be fewer to leave the pool in the future, causing a decrease in expected outflows in the future Conversely, assuming lower decrements early on will lower expected outflows in the early years while increasing expected outflows in the future Life Pricing \u2013 Goal is to cover the expected losses and achieve some level of profit Main factors to price based on: Gender Age Smoking Status Underwriting Loading Factors like Health Conditions, Foreigners, Occupation etc Life Insurance uses VNB, EV NBS etc Reserve = Claims \u2013 Prem Negative is good, means we are collecting more premium than claims Reserve only affects tge timing of profit Under RBC2, C1 risk charge is 95%VAR (~2SD) Sweet Spot is to hold 90% (~1SD) as PAD Don\u2019t hold too much as PAD because opportunity cost of capital Don\u2019t hold too little because regulator will challenge If set C1 = PAad, its an accounting trick to artificially increase the CAR of the company C1 and Pad are complement of each other EV = Value of In Force \u2013 Adjusted Net Worth Value in force = Future Profits Adjusted Net Worth ARE THE NON VALUABLE items History of EV > Hostile takeovers in the 1900s People unsure how to properly measure profitability Come up with EV as a way to measure the profitability Metric to shareholder since the share price is often not a reliable measure IFRS17 too aligned with the banks and Australian profit thingy GWP > Volume EV > Profitability NBEV > New business NBEV_TU > Minus top up from ILP holders Grwoth oriented metric No point to build a new prophet system Existing systems already use prophet, people know how to use prophet Very hard to break into the market Regulations in insurance exist because an information asymmetry exists between the seller and buyer of insurance products.

Regulators bridge this gap.","title":"2.1 Modelling VS Valuation"},{"location":"Archive/3_Life_Insurance/6_Management_Reporting/","text":"Management Reporting \u00b6 Management Reporting This note will largely focus on Embedded Value given its prevalence in the industry. However, other metrics unique to the life insurance industry will also be touched on at the end. Embedded Value \u00b6 Given the long-term nature of life insurance policies where profits emerge over the policy term , traditional financial accounting principles failed to accurately represent their profitability. This resulted in a low valuation of insurance companies and thus a series of unwanted acquisitions in the 1980s. To combat this, Embedded Value (EV) was developed to estimate the long-term profitability of a life insurance policy and thus provide a more accurate view of the company value from a shareholder's perspective . EV is thus a measure of the Shareholder Value of a life insurance company: \\[ \\text{Embedded Value (EV)} = \\text{Adjusted Net Worth (ANW)} + \\text{Value In Force (VIF)} \\\\ \\] EV is often voluntarily disclosed by the company, which can be used for a variety of purposes: Internal : Stock price justification, Incentive compensation External : Mergers & Acquisitions, Comparative Analysis Type of EV \u00b6 The methodology of EV has evolved over time, resulting in three distinct methodologies. Although there is no central governing entity on how it is reported, the industry has adopted the guidelines outlined in: Traditional Embedded Value (TEV): Association of British Insurers (2001) European Embedded Value (EEV): CFO Forum (2004) Market Consistent Embedded Value (MCEV): CFO Forum (2008) TBC to provide high level differences between the types. This note will largely focus on TEV - but the key concepts are largely transferrable to the other approaches. Adjusted Net Worth \u00b6 The first component is known as the Adjusted Net Worth (ANW) of the company. It is the Net Asset Value of the company, based on the book values of the components. However, some adjustments are typically made to it to reflect the true economic value of the company: \\[ \\text{Adjusted Net Worth} = \\text{Assets} - \\text{Liabilities} + \\text{Adjustments} \\] Note The book value of the components are often aligned to the latest published financial report . From an accounting perspective, net assets represent the shareholder's stake in the company. However, most solvency regulations require the company to hold additional capital on top of their reserve, known as the Required Capital (RC). The required capital is still owned by the shareholders but is not distributable as it is necessary by regulation for the company to operate. The remaining distributable portion of net assets is known as the Free Surplus (FS). Cost of Capital \u00b6 Although the required capital is owned by shareholders, it is locked into the company and cannot be immediately used for other purposes. When locked in this way, the capital generates less value to shareholders than it otherwise would have: Shareholders expect to earn the RDR on their capital However, since it is locked into the company, it can only earn an investment return based on the assets that it can be invested in Furthemore, since the investment income is earned by the company, it is subject to tax Info In most regulations, required capital must be held in low risk assets which thus generate low returns . Thus, the above differences creates an opportunity cost for shareholders, known as the Cost of Capital that is reduced from the value of RC: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Cost of Capital(t)} &= \\text{RC} \\cdot \\text{RDR} - \\text{RC} \\cdot \\text{ABC} \\cdot (1 - \\text{Corporate Tax}) \\\\ \\text{PVCoC} &= \\text{PV(Cost of Capital)} \\end{aligned} \\] Required Capital \u00b6 Actual RC not calculated within cashflow projection software because there are non-cashflow related components of RC C1: Insurance related C2: Asset related, Interest Mismatched linked to liabilities, others are not ORR: Non asset related Above is calculated at the fund level Need to replicate in projection software at the product level Done so by using a factor based approach to scale some metric inside the projetion to the RC AMOUNT most will use MCL ILP not suitable to use raw MCL because MCL tends to be 0 - thus another matric to consider is the equity shock Even for components calculated inside projection, need to have factors to diversify it IntMM Based on cashflows, need to do bottoms up approach to get change in liabilities Change in assets provided by a factor overall RC computed by comparing thesse two items Still need to diversify it, factor based Subfund diversification In RBC2 world, there is only par fund and non-par fund, all other cuts are arbitrary When attribute it to the individual funds/products and add up, there will be some problem sum of sqrt(c1^2 + c2^2) not equal to \\sqrt(sum c1^2 + sum c2^2) Need to use a factor to gross up to their reported amount Split at the fund level - products in the fund use the same factors Total assets (RC+MCL) then split into components using SAA, calculate the RC, repeat until equilibrium Value in Force \u00b6 The other component is known as the Value In Force (VIF), which is the present value of future profits from the in-force block of business. Profits in a company can either be reinvested back into the business or distributed to shareholders via dividends. VIF assumes that future profits are entirely distributed to shareholders, thus is counted towards EV. \\[ \\text{VIF} = \\text{PV(Profits)} - \\text{PV(CoC)} \\] Risk Discount Rate \u00b6 Shareholders took on risk to invest in the company. Thus, they require a rate of return higher than the risk free rate (RFR) to reflect the underlying risk of the company. It is commonly referred to as the Risk Discount Rate (RDR). The RDR will be used as the basis for discounting as it represents the minimum return that the shareholder expects. In most jurisdictions, Debt cannot be used to support capital requirements. Thus, the RDR is determined using the Cost of Equity , which is usually determined via the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) or its variants: \\[ \\text{RDR}_\\text{Equity} = \\text{RFR} + \\beta \\cdot (\\text{Market Return} - \\text{RFR}) \\] BEta should reflect underlying risk Industry and geographical location How to choose represrnative companies? Market weight? by what index? Note If Debt is allowed in some capacity, then the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) can be used instead: \\[ \\text{RDR}_\\text{WACC} = \\text{RDR}_\\text{Equity} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{E}{E+D} \\right) + \\text{RDR}_\\text{Debt} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{D}{E+D} \\right) \\] Future Profits \u00b6 An implicit assumption made is that there are future profits that will emerge over the life of the policy. Note This applies to both positive and negative profits. It simply means that the profits will not remain at zero throughout the life of the policy. To understand why profits will emerge, consider the expression for profit: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Profit(t)} &= \\text{Premium(t)} - \\text{Expenses(t)} - \\text{Benefits(t)} \\\\ &+ \\text{Investment Return(t)} - \\text{Increase in Reserve(t)} \\end{aligned} \\] Note Notice the similarities between the above cashflows and the ones used for valuation: Valuation Cashflows : Policy perspective Profit Cashflows : Shareholder perspective (Includes change in reserve and investment return) Prem Exp (Comm, fixed + var, init + ren) Ben (Death, Surr, Mat) - RI Prem (Pay to RI) + RI Rec (Claims that can be ceded to RI) + RI Comm (Paid to the Direct company, to cover the underwriting and acq costs associated with the policy, since the RI themselves did not acquire business) If reserves are calculated on the same basis as the projection, then there will be NO profit as the terms will cancel each other out: Release of reserves to cover the expected** net benefit and expenses; offsetting the net premiums received in the period Increase in reserves due to the unwinding** of discount; offsetting the investment income earned on the same amount Note Unwinding is the reversal of discounting. Consider the following: The discount rate is 10% There is a cashflow of $121 in two years time The present value of this cashflow today is $100 In exactly one year , the present value of the cashflow will be $110. The present value increases because there is one less year of discounting (all else equal). The increase in present value over time is known as the Unwinding for that period. However, most regulations require reserves to be calculated on a more conservative basis to ensure that the reserves are sufficient even if actual experience deviates significantly from expected: BE rates are loaded with risk margins (PAD) Cashflows are discounted at the RFR ; reserves expected to earn ABL rate Thus, a difference in basis between the projection and reserve will cause profit to emerge from the policy: Change of reserves will be different the expected benefits and expenses (net of premiums) Unwinding of reserves will be less than the expected investment income EV is calculated on a best-estimate basis while reserves are calculated on a conservative basis , resulting in emerging profits. In practice, companies must also pay corporate tax on their profits. Thus, Profits After Tax should be considered instead: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Profits after Tax} &= \\text{Profits} - \\text{Corporate Tax} \\\\ \\\\ \\therefore \\text{PVFP} &= \\text{PV(Profits After Tax)} \\end{aligned} \\] Note This is another reason why profits will not be zero - taxes are usually not accounted for in the reserve. Shareholder Profits \u00b6 Based on the above components, EV can be expressed as the following: \\[ \\text{EV} = \\text{FS} + \\text{RC} - \\text{PV(CoC)} + \\text{PV(Profits After Tax)} \\] Rather than calculating the last three components seperately, it can be calculated directly by considering the Profits to Shareholders : \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Profits to Shareholders} &= \\text{Profits After Tax} \\\\ &+ \\text{Investment Income on Capital} \\\\ &+ \\text{Tax on Investment Income} \\\\ &- \\text{Change in RC} \\\\ \\\\ \\therefore \\text{EV} &= \\text{FS} + \\text{PV(Profits to Shareholders)} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] The key is to understand that similar to PAD, the RC is not needed to support the policy benefits. Thus, it will gradually be released over the life of the policy. The value of the RC is thus captured via the PV(Change in RC) component. Since it is released over time, the RC is also expected to grow : Expected to grow by the RDR but only earns the post-tax ABC Grows by the post-tax ABC but discounted by the higher RDR PV of the RC decreases below its original value - difference is the Cost of Capital Thus, the CoC can be quantified in a different manner as the difference in the two profits: \\[ \\text{PV(CoC)} = \\text{PV(Profits to Shareholders)} - \\text{PV(Profits After Tax)} \\] Par Products \u00b6 Due to the unique properties of the participating fund, EV is calculated in a different manner: There is no CoC (VIF = PVFP) ANW is replaced by Estate Profits are recognized differently \\[ \\text{EV} = \\text{Estate} + \\text{PVFP} \\] Specific details on par fund management can be found in its respective set of notes. For this section, it is sufficient to understand the following: Par Fund assets are strictly ring-fenced from the rest of the company Net assets of the fund is known as the Surplus of the fund from which bonuses are paid An additional amount up to 1/9 th of the bonus declared can be transferred to shareholders into a Surplus Account within the par fund Transfer + Res prof Transfer is the yearly trasfers based on current bonus rate However, the current bonus rate may not fully exhaust the profit > Will have some spare profit > Residual Profit No coC because assumed that it is self sustaining, shareholders do not need to set up capital for it Link to NB strain Analysis of Movement \u00b6 The most important aspect of EV is not the value at any particular time, but rather how it changes from one period to another (usually one year). The process of breaking down the changes in EV into different Attributions is known as the Analysis of Movement (AoM): The AoM is often more important than the actual EV itself, as it provides actionable management information : Identifies key drivers of value Identifies areas for assumption review There are many ways of decomposing the movement that may be unique to each company's business profile. This section aims to cover the main attributions that will be part of every AoM: ANW PV(Profits) PV(CoC) EV Opening \\(A\\) \\(B\\) \\(C\\) \\(A+B+C\\) Attribution 1 Attribution 2 ... Ending \\(X\\) \\(Y\\) \\(Z\\) \\(X+Y+Z\\) Note The impact to PV(Profits) and PV(CoC) is straightforward as they are directly calculated in the projection. For ANW, consider its definition: \\[ \\text{ANW} = \\text{Assets} - \\text{Liabilities} \\] Assuming that there Stepwise Approach \u00b6 There are two methods to attribute the movements: Independent : Changes made in isolation ; model resets after each component Stepwise : Changes made incrementally ; model does not reset Generally, the stepwise approach is better as it accounts for interdependencies , allowing for the correlation among components to be reflected. Starting from the previous result, only one component is added on at a time incrementally to determine the impact of that component, till the final result is reached. If the attribution from one step to another is large, external analysis performed outside the model to further explain the impact. Different sequencing of components will lead to a slightly different attribution for each component as it affects where the correlation impacts are parked under - overall movement remains unchanged. Thus, a sequence that is operationally easier to execute is often chosen. Model Changes \u00b6 Over the year, the model used for projection will naturally be updated with new methodologies or to correct errors, naturally leading to some small variation in results. Similarly, assumptions would have been reviewed and updated based on the latest experience, resulting in some impact to the results, all else equal. It is usually broken down into several minor steps for each type of assumption changed: Mortality, Morbidity & Lapse Commission & Expense Investment Return on assets/funds Discount Rate Risk Free Rate & Exchange Rate Expected Return from Existing Policies \u00b6 When moving from one year to another, there are a few items we expect to change. Firstly, is the transfer of profits . Based on the opening position, the company expected to earn some profit in the first year of projection. Now that the year has passed, the company expects to realize these profits and thus they should no longer be classified under PV(Profits) but instead transferred to ANW . Note This is a reclassification from \"future earning\" (PVFP) to \"earned\" (ANW). The impact on both should be equal and opposite , resulting in no change to total EV. Secondly, is the unwinding of the interest. Moving one year into the future, we expect our assets and liabilities to grow: Assets Liabilities Earn one year of interest Discounted one year less Roll-forward using BEIR Roll-forward using RDR ANW PV(Profits) & PV(CoC) Warning An easy way to quantify this impact is to take the difference between: Opening Projection (t=0) Opening Projection (t=12) However, the first component contains the first year cashflows as well. Thus, that should be removed to ensure that the difference contains the impact purely due to the unwinding AND to ensure that there is no double counting with the transfer of profit. Expected Return from New Business \u00b6 New Business written over the year becomes part of the in-force block and is thus under the scope of EV . The EV generated from the block of new business is known as the Value New Business (VNB). Details about how VNB is computed can be found under its respective section. For the purposes of AoM, it is sufficient to know that regardless of when the business was written in the year, it is commonly treated as being just incepted on the valuation date (Duration In Force = 0). An implication of this is that the entire EV of the business is parked under PV(Profits) , when it should not be: Upon inception, the entire policy EV is captured under the PV(Profits) and PV(CoC) After one month, one month's worth of profits should be transferred from PV(Profits) to ANW Similarly, there is unwinding of the monthly earned interest and discount rate Note For instance, consider a policy incepted in September . At the end of the year , the policy should have: 3 months of expected profits earned in ANW 9 months of future profits in PV(Profits) and PV(CoC) 3 months of unwinding Notice that this is the same process as what was done for the existing in-force block, just at a monthly level rather than yearly. At this point, all the expected changes in EV have been covered. Thus, the remaining change represents unexpected changes that require further investigation . Experience Variance \u00b6 The most common approach taken to explain the difference is to compare actual experience with expected . This attribution is often referred to as Experience Variance . Due to the sheer number of assumptions made in the model, only a few critical assumptions are analyzed. Among them, they are typically broken down into the following components to provide greater insight: Economic Non Economic Out of management control Within management control Little can be done Action can be taken EG. Risk Free Rate EG. Expense For non-decrement related assumptions (EG. Expense or Investment Income), the variance can be determined as: \\[ \\text{Variance} = \\text{Reported Value in P&L} - \\text{Expected value in projection} \\] This variance is attributed entirely to ANW becuase it is concerning cashflows that have already occurred. However, for decrement assumptions (EG. Lapse and Mortality), there are two effects : Current Year : Paying more death benefit than expected Future Years : Fewer policies in-force in future years (Impact to Reserves & Future Profits) The current year effect is determined in the same way as the non-decrement assumptions - comparing what was actually paid against what was expected. The future year effect is complicated because it is hard to isolate the effect that multiple Multiple decrement, hard to isolate the effect from just lapse/death Capital Movements \u00b6 Any changes in capital over the year will affect EV: Dividends : Paid using free surplus; reduces ANW accordingly Capital Injections : Added into required capital; increases VIF accordingly Unexplained Movement \u00b6 Any remaining amount of EV movement that is not captured by the above attributions is referred to as the unexplained movement . It is expected that there will be some degree of unexplained movements as not all variances can be captured. That said, the unexplained movement should only form a small proportion of overall movement. HOWEVER, investment return on Assets backing liabilities DO NOT COUNT TOWARDS SHAREHOLDER VALUE this is because the investment return on this item is expected to support the policyholder onligation (sINCE BEL is discounted liabilities, expected earning rate is already accounted) Value New Business \u00b6 No real reason to model NBEV correctly because there is no incentive to do so since the total VIF remains the same Operating Profit \u00b6 Annual Premium Equivalent \u00b6 Annual Premium Equivalent (APE) is used a measure of sales for a block of policies, typically used as a measure of new business sales. Due to the different types of premium modes available (Regular, Limited & Single), the magnitude of the premium cannot be taken at face value . Thus, APE aims to standardize each premium to an equivalent regular premium amount so that they can be aggregated together. It assumes that a standard life insurance policy has a 10 year premium term - Single and regular premiums are thus scaled linearly to match this 10 year term: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{APE} &= \\text{Premium} \\cdot \\frac{Premium Term}{10} \\\\ \\\\ \\text{Total APE} &= \\text{Regular Premium} \\\\ &+ \\text{Limited Premium} \\cdot \\frac{Premium Term}{10} \\\\ &+ \\text{Single Premium} \\cdot 10% \\end{aligned} \\] Info 10% is often directly used in the formula for single premiums since it is fixed that they will only pay one year of premiums - which will always result in a 10% scaling. The above scaling is not perfect - it does not account for the difference in time value of money. However, the difference is often negligible and outweighed by the simplicity of the linear approach. APE is the preferred method of measuring of sales as it takes into account both the: Size of policies Mix of policies between RP, LP & SP New Business Strain \u00b6 Life Insurance policies typically incur a negative profit in the first year it is sold, known as the New Business Strain (NBS). This is due to the premium in the first year being insufficient to cover the high upfront costs of setting up a policy: Selling Expenses Establishing Reserves and Required Capital It is typically expressed as a percentage of the premium received: \\[ \\text{NB Strain} = \\frac{Negative Profit}{Premium} \\] From an accounting perspective, writing new business immediately reduces the solvency of the company as the shortfall is funded from shareholder capital. However, profits will be recovered over time: NBS is important because all companies strive to write more business - thus, it is important to minimize the strain created so that new business can be written more efficiently, without severely impacting solvency. Payback Period \u00b6 The Payback Period is the time taken for the policy to breakeven ; recover its NBS. It is a measure of how fast profit from the policy will emerge. It is deter Internal Rate of Return \u00b6","title":"**Management Reporting**"},{"location":"Archive/3_Life_Insurance/6_Management_Reporting/#management-reporting","text":"Management Reporting This note will largely focus on Embedded Value given its prevalence in the industry.

Note This is a reclassification from \"future earning\" (PVFP) to \"earned\" (ANW). The impact on both should be equal and opposite , resulting in no change to total EV. Secondly, is the unwinding of the interest. Moving one year into the future, we expect our assets and liabilities to grow: Assets Liabilities Earn one year of interest Discounted one year less Roll-forward using BEIR Roll-forward using RDR ANW PV(Profits) & PV(CoC) Warning An easy way to quantify this impact is to take the difference between: Opening Projection (t=0) Opening Projection (t=12) However, the first component contains the first year cashflows as well.

An implication of this is that the entire EV of the business is parked under PV(Profits) , when it should not be: Upon inception, the entire policy EV is captured under the PV(Profits) and PV(CoC) After one month, one month's worth of profits should be transferred from PV(Profits) to ANW Similarly, there is unwinding of the monthly earned interest and discount rate Note For instance, consider a policy incepted in September .

These mechanisms are meant to discourage individuals from choosing expensive providers and discourage them from seeking excessive treatment . This reduces the cost to insurers, allowing them to keep premiums affordable. However, some criticism is that these mechanisms may discourage individuals from seeking seemingly minor treatments, which could possibly snowball into something more serious, resulting in an even larger claim for the insurer (counterproductive). Panel Doctors \u00b6 Health insurance claims are made through healthcare providers rather than from the individual to the insurer. This is so that individuals do not need to fork out a large lump sum of cash for treatment; Healthcare providers will claim against your insurance to recover the cost of treatment instead. Given this arrangement, people will only go to providers where their insurance plan covers them. Insurers prefer lower healthcare costs to manage their costs while healthcare providers want to charge a high cost in order to increase their profits. Insurers want to cover only the lowest cost providers, but needs to have a sufficiently wide coverage for their policyholders. Similarly, healthcare providers want to charge the highest possible cost, but needs to be covered by an insurer for sufficient demand. Thus, insurers typically make a deal with healthcare providers such that they provide cover for them in exchange for lower cost - a balance between the two parties interest. These providers are often known as Network Providers . Most policies provide better coverage for network providers or only cover network providers. Higher premiums may be charged for coverage outside of the insurers network. Singapore Health Insurance System \u00b6 Healthcare is a public sector and as such depends heavily on the socio-political environment of the country. As a result, different countries have different healthcare systems & hence different health insurance landscape. Singapore provides government subsidised public healthcare for all services. Specifically for hospitalization expenses, individuals are put through means testing to determine the level of subsidy provided. The means testing is dependent on the type of ward chosen - only class C and B2 wards are eligible for subsidies. Within these two categories, the final amount is dependent on their monthly income. Medishield Life \u00b6 Singapore has a basic national Medical Expense insurance plan for all Singaporeans and PRs known as Medishield Life . It is automatically paid for from the Medisave account under CPF, who manages the policy. It is designed to partially reimburse basic public healthcare costs , but can also be used to partially reimburse certain private costs as well, capped at what it would have been in the public sector. Individuals can additionally purchase a private health insurance plan that works on top of Medishield, collectively known as an Integrated Shield Plan . Instead of paying two seperate premiums, only one premium needs to be paid to the private insurer, who will pass on the Medishield portion to CPF. Medisave can be used to pay the entire medishield portion, as well as part of the private portion. The integrated plan naturally covers a wider range of health conditions with higher reimbursements. MediFund \u00b6 Singapore's social safety net program is known as MediFund , which covers only the most basic of services. It is provided on a case by case basis, typically when the Medisave account has been depleted. It is by definition, a safety net - meant to catch people who are falling to prevent them from dying, but not meant to return them to where they fell from. It provides a minimum amount of welfare that the government has agreed nobody should fall below.

We say that the Reinsurer assumes responsibility for part of the loss \u2022 The Reinsurance company can also take up reinsurance to limit exposure to losses, known as Retrocession o Important that Reinsurance companies do not eventually form a circular loop where a reinsurer is reinsuring part of themselves o However, reinsurance may be provided for by another company in the corporate group. In this case, it is known as Captive Reinsurance \u2022 Thus, instead of Retroceding to another Reinsurance Company, they could Retrocede the risk to the Capital Markets instead in the form of Insurance-Linked-Securities (EG. Catastrophe Bonds) \u2022 Unlike regular insurance, one contract could involve several reinsurers at once or multiple reinsurance contracts could be issued to cover one risk (Each taking a different part of it) \u2022 However, the Cedant is not absolved of all risk. Having a reinsurance agreement in place does NOT relieve the obligations of the original insurer to the policyholder. They are reliant on the Reinsurer indemnifying them, thus there is still some level of Credit Risk that the Cedant is exposed to Why Reinsurance? \u2022 Consider from an insurance company\u2019s perspective, why they would want Reinsurance: o Precisely manage their risks. Insurers can choose which risks they want to retain and cede out the portion they don\u2019t want to. This can be beneficially when trying to manoeuvre around regulatory solvency requirements o Stabilize business results. Instead of the potentially having high frequency or large claims, it is replaced with a fixed premium. This makes performance more predictable which could have tax benefits or relaxed capital requirements o Increase underwriting capacity. Since only a portion of the risk is actually assumed by the insurer, they can afford to write risks that would have otherwise been too big. This ensures that most events are insurable at an affordable price o Protect against Catastrophe Losses. Catastrophes often hit an entire region at a time, which would instantly bankrupt an insurer as their risks tend to be concentrated in a particular region. However, Reinsurers operate globally; thus they can afford to reinsurer for Catastrophe Risks \u2022 Reinsurance tends to focus more on the General Insurance side of things given the large risk that they write. However, there are trends in the Life Insurance side as well in the form of Financial Reinsurance Captive Insurance Setting up another insurance company to insure against your own losses Main benefit is mainly capital constraints, tax, funding etc Regulated alternative to self insurance > Less tempted to take the money Offer direct access to reinsurance and act as an investment vehicle The problem with that approach is its lack of a formal structure, creating the temptation to access the funds for other purposes and ambiguity about how much coverage a firm actually has. With a captive, on the other hand, the funds are segregated and held in a regulated, audited vehicle, which can help the firm go out and attain more cover from the reinsurance market. To be clear: the captive would insure only its parent company, not competitors. aid over the years his firm has been quoted insurance many times at prices which were \u201cridiculous and obscene.\u201d If pricing is too high in the commercial insurance markets or no underwriters are willing to cover a firm\u2019s risk, captives are used to formalize self-insurance with reporting on capital and reserve requirements. Captives are typically set up for more niche products (though not always) so I suppose the only disadvantage is if you work on some niche product at a captive and then later that work doesn't translate to other more general career options. > Hard to get priced Introduction to Reinsurance Treaties Based on policy coverage Facultative Treaty Contracts are underwritten on an individual risk basis; the reinsurer has the option to reject each risk Contracts are underwritten for an entire class of business (Similar risk); reinsurer cannot reject any individual risk \u2022 There is a hybrid version known as Facultative Obligatory Treaty \u2013 The Cedant gets to decide which risks within the portfolio they want to Cede, and the Reinsurer cannot reject whatever they choose to cede out \u2022 Most reinsurance contracts are treaties, only a small ~15% are Facultative Based on policy operation Proportional (Pro-Rata) Non-Proportional (Excess of Loss; XL) Quota Share Surplus Per Risk XL (Working XL) Per Event XL (Cat XL) Aggregate XL (Stop Loss) Covers a fixed percentage of the risk Covers ALL surplus over a retention limit Covers losses above the retention limit of the policy, up to the policy limit Covers large losses from multiple policies from a single event (Catastrophe) Covers losses based on overall frequency instead of size Other points \u2022 Reinsurance contracts typically mirror the terms & exclusions of the underlying risk it is insuring \u2022 Since Reinsurance is a contract surrounding two professional entities, the guidelines and regulations are very different compared to primary insurer \u2022 Financial Reinsurance is a very up and coming thing Sum at risk of the reinsurer Calculated at the benefit level for each individual benefit Calculated based on the amount ceded to reinsurer RI Premium = SAR * RI Premium Rate Insurer will clacualte SAR and the corresponding premium, send to Reinsurer to verify and check This is known as the Statement of Account The basis is agreed beforehand with the insurer on how to calcualte SAR Some SAR is complicated because some want/dont want to include SAR, because technically we are holding reserves for the benefits, nothing at risk to the reinsurer Problem is that if this the case, then need to align on the reserving basis with the resinurer, which is hard for both parties to agree All the terms is captured under the Treaty binding agreement","title":"1 Reinsurance Overview"}]}
